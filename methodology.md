# Trading System

## Core Beliefs

Based on my 2007-2014 experience where I sent an inordinate amount of time breaking even at trading with a tiny account before throwing in the towel, and then subsequently coming back in 2025, my conclussion is that timeframes shorter than 2 weeks are essentially noise. And to determine the trend of a stock or the overall market you need to hold for at least 4 weeks.

Furthermore, many big winners have 3-6 week flat consolitation periods where they are essentially flat even during their strong uptrends, so a good strategy is to buy 4 weeks into those and then hold for 4 weeks to determine if the uptrend is intact. The same goes for buying dips. Big winners during the smooth and strong part of the uptrend often have 4 week dips or consolitations, but it's rare to see 8 week periods where they don't make a new high on a weekly line chart. And they always go up after 12 weeks assuming they are in a strong uptrend.

So thinking about it in counterfactuals, if you buy 4 weeks into a consolitation and after 4 weeks the stock hasn't made another leg up, that makes it much more likely that it's topping, or that it's in a weak uptrend, and you don't want to participate in that.

If there has been a 12 week period on the weekly line chart where the stock has made tepid progress, then most likely the trend is flat.

If possible I wish that needing to trade on a 2-12 week timescale wasn't the market reality, and during my failure years, I spent a lot of time trying to find places where there'd be daily trending behavior instead of monthly, but monthly (4 week) trends are where the money is in the market. I wanted to buy after updays and sell after downdays, but the price behavior at those timescales is just too noisy to be tradable. In fact, there is a tendency to counter trend instead, so what works is buying dips and selling rallies, but in the risk/reward is very asymetric there. Though it's very much possible to be profitable trading like that, I'd rather take a small risk for a large gain than vice versa.

Ideally, rather than spending 12 weeks to determine whether to exit, I should strive to trade the market leaders and use a 8 week period instead to determine when to exit. I've observed that market leaders often slow down on an 8 week timescale despite them going up and that turns out to be a good sell signal. Once their strong uptrend changes to a weak uptrend, it becomes a good idea to sell into the highs and move to a different stock. Another good time to sell is once the uptrend turns into a buying histeria and the price explodes upwards.

Hence, I want to trade in a trend following manner with the right beliefs, and it's actually took me an insane amount of time to finally conclude that the daily price action is noise, and that the main issue with my trading in the 2007-2014 timeframe was I was getting fooled by noise. Even though back then I tried to let my profits run and cut my losses, I was simply too desperate to limit risk, and just kept getting stopped out prematurely.

I was irrationally afraid of holding stocks for longer, and wasn't listening to what the market and my own results were telling me. I kept searching for the silver bullet, and a part of that reason is that my account was simply too small for me to trade comfortably. Looking back, you could say that my account size was the primary factor in determining my trading style and strategy, rather than any objective analysis of the price action. I just kept rotating from stock to stock, hoping that the obviously failing system would work.

Another reason why I failed is that I set a goal of becoming rich quickly. I rember saying to myself that I need to make a lot of money within 6 months, otherwise I would be losing too much time. Given that kind of mindset, combined with limited funds to trade, it was no wonder that even though I had to trade on montly timescales, the market noise whipped me into contracting my time horizons to the daily scale. Had it not been for the pattern daytrading rule, it's likely that I would have tried trading even shorter term.

Trying to make money quickly ended up wasting over half a decade of my life. Combined that with the opportunity cost of the 11 years I was out of the market after giving up makes the price that I paid was enormous, despite not losing money.

## Trade Entries

Lately, I've read Mark Minervini's books, whose trading methodology is very similar to Wiliam O'Neil's and they recommend buying breakouts right at the precise pivot point. The issue with this approach is that the examples feel very cheery picked, and in the example charts of past big winners, the main commonality that I could find is that they keep going up month after month.

I haven't found buying breakouts to work well, so I actually think that once a stock has been assumed to be in a strong uptrend, that it's actually okay to buy at random times, or minor dips despite their advice no to buy when a stock is extended past its buy point.

One criticism of this approach is that often these breakouts happen at random stocks on random days, so unless you're a full time trader watching a 1,000 of stocks you'll miss them. You'll also miss them due to holding other stocks and not having the money to buy them.

So what I'll do is aim to rotate my failures into perceived market leaders every 4 weeks, and not worry too much about precise entry timing, hoping the trend will take care of it.

The general plan is that I should be holding market leaders in strong uptrends. Suppose one of such supposed leaders ends up being a failure and I sell it. I'd now have the cash that I could put in other stocks. At that point, I can do two things:

* Wait for another stock to break out and buy it at its pivot point.
* Add more to existing leaders which have broken out in the past and have proven themselves.

I am leaning towards the latter even if it means chasing a stock that might be overextended. I'll try to buy them on 4 week dips or consolidations.

I am convinced that holding stocks for a proper amount of time is more important than precise entries.

Also, precise entries are in coflict with averaging up as the trend progresses. Since 2 week periods have some signal, I think that adding to a position that appreciates every 2 weeks is how it should be done.

The reality is that trading commitions have gone down, the markets have become more efficient than in the 20th century due to the digital revolution, everybody is looking at charts, and everybody knows to buy new highs and sell lows now. It's common trading knowledge at this juncture, popularized in no small part by William O'Neil. Stocks will just blow past the ideal buy points without mercy, or emerge in a noisy manner in order to shake out weak momentum traders. The evolution of the markets is needs to be factored into one's trading, and it will only ever be that systems that worked in the past will stop working. And the shorter the timescale, the more efficient the markets will be and consequence, the more the price action will resemble noise.

The more the price action resembles noise, the less important precise entries become, because if it is noise, whether it it goes up or down after you buy it is just a matter of luck. So it's fine to buy on dips or consolidations.

Breakouts are extremely obvious, and they do have an important function of telling me that the stock is in an uptrend, but if I could already see that this is the case I won't assume they have any other added benefit.

## Trade Selection

I am at a huge informational disadvantage in the market. Lately I've been reading the Unknown Market Wizards book by Jack Schwager and it made me realize that I could never immitate some of the approaches due to lack of real world awareness or knowledge. Even if I take some financial or economics classes, I'll likely never know much more than the guy on the street. No wait, scratch that.

The guy on the street is at least interacting with the real world, while I am in front of my computer screen 12h a day, trading only part time and doing introvent work like programming. And I will mostly be trading stocks in other countries like the US or in the EU, while I am all the way in Croatia.

So for selecting my trading vehicle, I don't have much choice than to go with a momentum approach.

I do think that a stock's overall pattern provides important hints as to its future trajectory, and in addition it does provide hints what it's trajectory will be. High momentum stocks continue to be high momentum stocks, smooth stocks continue to be smooth, and volatilty perists during the uptrend. It's best to buy low volatility stocks that have good persistence on the weekly line charts because once the the trend starts to shift, low volatility will become high volatility and the persistence will become weak. It's best to judge this on the basis of past 8 weeks. In fact, when it comes to estimating volatility it pays to look at the daily charts.

For estimating the trend, you have to look at 2 week segments, but for estimating the volatility, the candle ranges on the daily charts offer important clues. Generally the volatility goes through the roof after a huge rise, but sometimes it ends up being just as small as before. I'd want to sell after huge rises, but if the stock isn't going down for 4 weeks after that and it's daily volatility is still low, I'd consider going back in.

Sometimes a stock that seems very choopy on the weekly chart will suddenly contract and it's weekly closes will start to cluster together, and it will persistently start to go up month after month. That's an important clue.

In fact, for this particular paragraph, one of the recent leaders that comes to mind isn't even a stock, but a crypto currency. It used to be very choopy, then the volatility contracted and it went into a 2 year long uptrend, the same principles apply for them.

Recently I've read the `Quantitative Momentum: A Practitioner’s Guide to Building a Momentum-Based Stock Selection System` book, which showed an edge for buying stocks with 6-12 relative momentum and rebalancing montly. They also discovered that for shorter term momentum the edge goes away, and for 1-month momentum it's even negative. This finding is consistent with my view that I should be buying either randomly or 4 week dips or consolitations. It doesn't have to strictly be flat, it can be up a little, but it's probably best to avoid buying into sharp rises.

So I'd look for high 6-month performance, and look at whether the stock has made large moves even before that time. I'd also carefully observe how it made those moves. Looking at the past 6 month of a stock that has gone up by 200% as an example, it's better if a stock has made those moves by going up 20% month after month, than with huge infrequent gap moves.

Besides this, one important thing is to look at how ETFs are behaving.

A whole group going up by 50% in the last 6 months, is a lot more powerful signal than a single stock going up by that amount. To eliminate the chance of randomness from price moves, a very strategy is to find the best performing ETFs and buy just their best performers. I've seen some market research that said that buying best performing groups gives you 20% per year, but they called buying the best performing stock in a group the holy grail of investing as it gives 50% per year.

With group moves you know the strong move isn't an illusion, and that other investors will be directing their funds into the broad group.

In fact, I'd rather trade this than random momentum picks.

Right now (6/29/2025, Sunday) for example, I am long an european defense stock ETF. The uptrend is very obvious as is the fundamental catalyst, so there is a decent chance of it persisting. Also, the market broke 2 months ago due to Trump's tarrif announcement, and the group showed extreme resilience to that break, so I am expecting another leg up. Also it has consolitated it's gains for the last 4 weeks, so according to my theory of how a stock in a strong uptrend should behave, it should make another upleg in the next 4 weeks.

Since I've just re-entered trading after a 11 year hiatus, I am really looking forward to finding out how well my current theory will work. The thing I am most afraid of is what I'll do if it closes flat 4 weeeks from now. It's going to be super awkward to sell a proven market leader and the best group just as the general market is starting a new upleg, that had shown strong resilience to the earlier break, which is a signal superior to any other technical pattern that I know, and with a strong fundamental catalyst. I'll just have to do it and rotate into rando momentum stocks, but I do hope I won't need to as the pattern here is a huge opportunity.

If it does poorly in the next 2 weeks, I'll sell it right then instead of waiting for full 4 weeks to elapse.

## Market Timing

Back when I was starting out in 2007, I was essentually trying out the same approach as I am now. I would load up my porfolio that had nothing to do with the market. If you'd taken any of their charts, and compared them to the S&P or the Nasdaq, you'd see nothing in common. And yet, I was shocked to find that when rougly speaking, when the market would go up 1%, my portfolio would go up 2%, and when it would go down 1%, my porfolio would go down 2%. I couldn't understand it at the time, but I realized quickly that in the short term, the primary factor in the motion of a stock is where the rest of the market is going.

I don't have good rules at this point where to get out, but market leaders top ahead of the general market so the 8 week rule should suffice to get me out of the leaders ahead of time before the broader market cracks. In fact their breakdowns is what will drag the rest of the market down.

One of the rules is to avoid making any new trades while the past leaders are cracking and the market is in a general decline. If you're holding stocks have recently broken out and might be future market leaders, and are acting resilient, it's hard to tell purely by price action whether they'll break and get swept up by the general market action and declining sentiment.

The general market breaks tend to be fast, so I'd use a 2-4 week period to evaluate this.

According to this insight, if the market is acting awkward, I plan to get out, and wait 2 weeks and after it has been confirmed that the decline has been arrested, I will turn bullish again with the intention of buying in two week steps on the way up.

And there are special rules for how to get in.

In short, in two week steps on the way up after a big break.

# Trade Analysis

At the time of writing this, I am 3.5 months roughly into my part time trading career. Having written out these rules, I realize that it's not going to be good enough to just have them down and expect anyone to be able to apply them. I also forgot to cover how to take losses, which should be done using 2 week time stops. We'll do that during actual trade analysis. The market timing got a bit complicated in April and had I obeyed the 2 week rule to sell losses, I would have sold out in a panic, so it's great that I didn't do it. Let's go over it from the start, which is roughly mid March.
