10:10am. In order to help ensure discipline in my trading, I've decided according to my usual style to open a public trading journal.

Because of my work with Tao Ceti, I am too busy to spend monologuing in the Spiral language or the ML library repo, and I am probably being a nuisance posting stock market & trading related messages in the company's Discord channel. It's not a big deal since there are only 2 other guys there, but I doubt they are interested in this, so I should move that kind of posting in its proper place.

I've been considering various avenues to improve my trading.

One option would be to put some effort into actually understanding what I am trading, so I am considering learning finance and economics. There should be good courses on these subjects like on platforms like Coursera or Udacity. I should also start doing fundamental research. But I am skeptical of those approaches to getting better for reasons I will get into later.

Over the past week I've had many days when I've been stressed out due to the market specifically, and had trouble sleeping. Being tired the next day has been impacting my performance at work negatively. And it's not really pleasant to be awake a couple of nights in a row because my brain is simply refusing to switch off and get some rest, even though I was lying in bed.

I've started trading 3 months ago, and my holding periods are long so there haven't been many of them, so I'll be going over them later. But for now, let me start with the most important part of this repo which is describing my trading methodology. I'll do that in a separate file.
