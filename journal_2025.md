10:10am. In order to help ensure discipline in my trading, I've decided according to my usual style to open a public trading journal.

Because of my work with Tao Ceti, I am too busy to spend monologuing in the Spiral language or the ML library repo, and I am probably being a nuisance posting stock market & trading related messages in the company's Discord channel. It's not a big deal since there are only 2 other guys there, but I doubt they are interested in this, so I should move that kind of posting in its proper place.

I've been considering various avenues to improve my trading.

One option would be to put some effort into actually understanding what I am trading, so I am considering learning finance and economics. There should be good courses on these subjects like on platforms like Coursera or Udacity. I should also start doing fundamental research. But I am skeptical of those approaches to getting better for reasons I will get into later.

Over the past week I've had many days when I've been stressed out due to the market specifically, and had trouble sleeping. Being tired the next day has been impacting my performance at work negatively. And it's not really pleasant to be awake a couple of nights in a row because my brain is simply refusing to switch off and get some rest, even though I was lying in bed.

I've started trading 3 months ago, and my holding periods are long so there haven't been many of them, so I'll be going over them later. But for now, let me start with the most important part of this repo which is describing my trading methodology. I'll do that in a separate file.

8:25pm. I'll do the analysis later as I am really tired from writing that [large document](/methodology.md). Hopefully this will allow me to reach catharsis. I just want to get this out so I can sleep well during the night.

I wish I could just tell my brain to take a break, but that isn't how it works for me.

Sheridan Titman On His Seminal Paper on Momentum Investing and What He Has Learned Since

Watching this video and he says some very interesting things like that momentum actually works better the more efficient the market is. It works best in the US, but in Japan or China it doesn't.

Will work on trade analysis during the weekend. Don't feel like it during my workdays.

So far the week did start out pretty challenging. I absolutely must hold this week and the next 3. As scary as the market is now, it's much more dangerous to sell out early than late.

9:40am. I got up early today I started wondering about Japanese stocks and whether what Sheridan said was true.

So what I've been doing for the past hour is going over the stock charts of all the Japanese stocks sorted by 6 month momentum, and I cannot find even a single one worth trading.

The 8-week uptrend rule simply doesn't work, the momentum stocks just spike and then sit there for months. They also generally have huge and sudden declines, and have wild swings all over the place. There is no trend, they just pierce. So I think he is right.

I am sure that if I only had the Tokyo market to trade, I might as well retire.

I didn't realize at all how much my method is dependant on liquidity. It does seem to be the case that the more efficient the market is, the better it works. Japan needs a proper bull market to draw the money into it.

Given the lesson, I think the top down approach is even more important than I thought. There is a bull market is europe which will make my methods work well. Having the money come into the market is what is needed for liquidity, which should ameliorate the wild swings we see in Tokyo stocks.
