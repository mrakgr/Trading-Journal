# Overview

I like how unlike in git commit messages I can also insert images in the markdown. I'll be using this for my journaling needs.

The Ultimate Guide to PRO Trading

This video by Andrea Cimitan lives up to its name. Since Hopfield dictionaries failed, I'll be going into trading. It really hurts to drop poker, but I want to take some time to work on trading systems. I think I would have enjoyed hand crafting the cost functions if I put my mind to it. I'll make up for it by applying the process to trading instead.

[Bookmap](https://bookmap.com/learning-center/en) has a large number of good tutorials. In particular check the 4 part course starting with the [order flow video](https://youtu.be/3m_Stn4hxCQ).

Initially, this repo started as a trading journal, but since mid September I've also started using it as a regular one. Currently I've gone back to working on the poker bot and am gearing up to start work on the **Hopfield Dictionary CFR Preliminaries**. But if you're looking for trading strategy ideas, it has a fair amount strewn throughout the various posts. I'd heartily recommend looking into [Stockbee](https://www.youtube.com/@Stockbeevideos) and [Qullamaggie](https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/) for swing trading, [SMB Capital](https://www.youtube.com/@smbcapital) and [Lance Breitstein](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOneLanceB) for daytrading. After I am done with poker whenever that might be, I'll likely come back to trading.

Compared to 2007 - 2014 when I was last active as a trader, there are amazingly good learning resources on the Internet if you can sift through the fakers.
