10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

Trade of the month. One day I'll be capable of catching them.

More data centers in space nonsense. I thought it was a joke by Bezos, but Elon is now seriously pushing it.

The Nightmare.

7:45pm. I guess this week it's another downleg in the market. Gold and silver dumped, and BTC is now solidly below 80k.

I myself am done making simplistic models. I need to move on to making realistic ones.

The plan is to take a break from programming and go through the SMB Capital course that I downloaded a while ago.

I need to start baking in actual order flow patterns into the generative model. Swapping between episodes is very obvious.

8:50pm. I'll slow down my pace and think more carefully how I want to do modeling.

In efficient markets it's hard to do trend following. The patterns where drift/volatility is greater than 0.1 is rare.

Most of the patterns are volatility with no drift.

9:05pm. Starting tomorrow, I am going to slow down. Yeah, just programming isn't going to get me far. I need to start studying again.

I know 1 pattern which is the held bid/offer, but there have to be other ones. I need to get everything I can from SMB.

Then I will try coding it up into a coherent system. If it turns out that tape reading absolutely cannot be distilled into a neural network then so be it. I'll apologize to Thomas for misleading him again (the first time was the Hopfield dictionary) and move on to something else.

The 107k I have lying around is permission for me to put the try this. If I am not going to do it now then when?

Ok, so price patterns on 1s charts are one thing, but there could very well be differences when I look into actual order flow, especially at extreme situations.
