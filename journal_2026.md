10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.
