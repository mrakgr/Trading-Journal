# Overview

I like how unlike in git commit messages I can also insert images in the markdown. I'll be using this for my journaling needs.

Initially, this repo started as a trading journal, but since mid September I've also started using it as a regular one. Currently I've gone back to working on the poker bot and am gearing up to start work on the **Hopfield Dictionary CFR Preliminaries**. But if you're looking for trading strategy ideas, it has a fair amount strewn throughout the various posts. I'd heartily recommend looking into [Stockbee](https://www.youtube.com/@Stockbeevideos) and [Qullamaggie](https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/) for swing trading, [SMB Capital](https://www.youtube.com/@smbcapital) and [Lance Breitstein](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOneLanceB) for daytrading. After I am done with poker whenever that might be, I'll likely come back to trading.

Compared to 2007 - 2014 when I was last active as a trader, there are amazingly good learning resources on the Internet if you can sift through the fakers.
