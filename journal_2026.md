10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

![](images/image-2038.png)

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

5pm. ![](images/image-2039.png)

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

![](images/image-2040.png)
> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

![](images/image-2041.png)

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

![](images/image-2042.png)

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

![](images/image-2043.png)

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

1/29/2026

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

The Nightmare.

7:45pm. I guess this week it's another downleg in the market. Gold and silver dumped, and BTC is now solidly below 80k.

I myself am done making simplistic models. I need to move on to making realistic ones.

The plan is to take a break from programming and go through the SMB Capital course that I downloaded a while ago.

I need to start baking in actual order flow patterns into the generative model. Swapping between episodes is very obvious.

8:50pm. I'll slow down my pace and think more carefully how I want to do modeling.

In efficient markets it's hard to do trend following. The patterns where drift/volatility is greater than 0.1 is rare.

Most of the patterns are volatility with no drift.

9:05pm. Starting tomorrow, I am going to slow down. Yeah, just programming isn't going to get me far. I need to start studying again.

I know 1 pattern which is the held bid/offer, but there have to be other ones. I need to get everything I can from SMB.

Then I will try coding it up into a coherent system. If it turns out that tape reading absolutely cannot be distilled into a neural network then so be it. I'll apologize to Thomas for misleading him again (the first time was the Hopfield dictionary) and move on to something else.

The 107k I have lying around is permission for me to put the try this. If I am not going to do it now then when?

Ok, so price patterns on 1s charts are one thing, but there could very well be differences when I look into actual order flow, especially at extreme situations.

2:25pm. Here is what it takes to get hired at SMB.

* 100 trades in the last 60 trading sessions.
* Winners bigger than losses.
* Going through the SMB Training.

https://payment.smbtraining.com/smbspecial/trainingcamp-re.php

4k price tags. I don't have enough in my bank account even if I wanted to. I'll leave it for later.

I am going to focus on the old course, and if I am having success with that I'll definitely go through the main one even if it means paying 2-4k in fees. Because if I could attain profitability it would be worth it. Right now it isn't.

Who knows whether shelling out money for this is right or not, but either way it will take me time to build up a track record and make these systems. I am not in a hurry. Let me start with day 2 from the old course and I'll go from there.

2:30pm. Let me do the chores and then I will get started with the course.

![](images/image-2052.png)

I wonder if the dumbass founders are still long this shit or if they've bailed earlier? I bet BTC is very scary to hold for many people right now. Stock indices just refuse to collapse though despite the fundamentals getting worse and worse.

The Killer Mistake to Avoid at All Costs

Let me watch this.

I am trying to figure out what my goals are. I thought about the opening plays and yes, that is what I want to do. Forget generating the whole day, I'll cut out everything, but the first hour and focus solely on that to start off.

My beginner's strategy will be to focus only on the first hour. I'll generate some consolidations and some opening drives and focus solely on that.

The random price action model is quite powerful. I can take advantage of deviations from it.

As I go through the SMB course, I will focus just on that, the opening drive.

4:10pm. Let me start going through the course. This will take me a while.

4:15pm. ![](images/image-2053.png)

This is my first time seeing Brett Steenbarger talk. I used to read just blog a lot back in the day.

> You want to trade with a microscope - that's the tape, and trade with the telescope, that's the big picture.
> I want to be my goals, not just have goals! Do you see the difference? Too many people have goals, like you have a car, you have a goal. It's something separate from you.
> And finally the best goals are based on strengths, on what do well.

Great talk and I am already halfway in.

4:45pm. Balance vs imbalance. I think I understand it now. Balance is when drift < volatility. When it's below 0.1 the noise dominates the drift. And when it's the opposite That is when you breakouts. In the market, I find that it goes between extremes.

I'll really want to get my hands on trade sides and study those in nuance.

I think I need to introduce a concept. A trade can be highly probable to hit the bid or the ask, but at the same time when you have absorbtions or held levels, those levels tend to hold. In other words, in breakouts to the upside, the bids should be holding. Volume on the bid shouldn't drop the price, but volume on the ask should lead to the levels rising.

And in absorbtion, strong momentum to the upside where trades are mostly getting executed on the ask will start having difficulty pushing prices up.

The model I have now doesn't represent this well.

4:55pm. Yeah, this is a major weakness of my modeling effort.

I need to model the passive and aggresive flow and the interplay between them.

5pm. The sooner I start thinking about the bids and the asks the better. I have to admit the experiments really made me realize just how the drift and volatility components interact.

Let me finish the video instead of falling into thought here.

5:30pm. ![](images/image-2054.png)

Watching this again. He says the downside is 1-2 pennies and the upside is 30-100 cents for unusual holds on the bid.

Yeah, this is what I want.

Imagine if I was a big buyer. I'd start off accumulating slowly and then stepping up once the level has been exhausted. I just need to look for those kinds of patterns, but at the same time I want to see all of SMB's setups, at least from that time.

I need to model this and the order book to a simplified degree.

6:20pm. ![](images/image-2055.png)

Today I learned about coming back to the bid pattern. 

6:25pm. I'll stop here for the day. It's going to be hell to bake all of this into the model. I am going to learn to both read the tape and model quantitatively.

This is only day 2 and the course is 25 days long so I have my work cut out for me.

I wonder why in the later courses they put less of an emphasis on tape reading? Do the retail fish traders not like it?

Who knows, maybe it's this course that I actually need rather than the up to date versions. It's all tape reading.

Let's see if I can maintain a pace of 1 day of the course per real life day.

9:25pm. ![BTCUSD](images/image-2056.png)

Bitcoin is absolutely melting. If this doesn't crush the markets eventually, I don't know what will. The indices just refuse to go down.

![QQQ](images/image-2057.png)

I mean, it is going down, but it's still solidly above April lows.

2/6/2026

5:45pm. I'll consider today a vacation. This really bring me to the old Spiral days when I was engrossed in my thoughts the whole day.

I have a bunch of a good ideas that I wrote in an email to Thomas. Here is a segment of it:

///

I've had some inspiration over the night about this which is making me feel more hopeful. A plan is coming together for me.

First, I don't think it's possible to emulate the reasoning that discretionary tape reading traders do with NNs. Another thing I am realizing is that my generative models won't be good when it comes to modeling realistic order flow. Another issue is that the most realistic price action so far is the one that is generated by completely random models (with no drift).

But now I've had a realization that if the market really is random, then it has to be random at the level of individual trades. So an experiment is coming to mind. If I train a NN on my synthetic moves and let is label the price of Bitcoin for example, would it conclude that the entire thing was generated from a completely random distribution, or will the network detect individual episodes which have positive and negative drift.

If there is a strong uptrending move that has lasted for a few minutes for example, there will be a large difference between it being generated by a distribution with a strong drift relative to volatility and a distribution with no drift and high volatility, even though it might look the same on a chart. I've realized that even if I am using 1s charts, that might obscure the underlying pattern.

It's very weird. This is something that only ever occurred to me now that I am creating generative models. The basic problem is that if have numerous distributions with different drift and volatility components, how can I prevent the NN from telling them apart purely based on volatility of individual trades? And the truth is that it's probably impossible. When I add the trade aggresor fields, it's going to be even easier. Adding trade sizes in the latest iteration already makes it very obvious when an episode has changed because the new episode has different volume patterns. But if that is how it is in simulated settings, what does that imply for real life ones? It never over occurred to me to think along these lines.

One great idea that I've had last night is that I could have the NN labels the moves it sees in real life data, and I could then use real life occurrences of those moves to adjust the generative model, which could make the model even more precise after it has been retrained on the updated model.

///

Some of the recent insights are completely changing the way I look at price action, and I am blown away by them.

If this really works, it could be huge. I'll finally be able to understand how the markets really work.

I really need to go through the SMB course and then I will put them to the test. SMB will give the nuances I might miss in my theoretic modeling.

I am also considering going into crypto because the high quality data is cheap there and gives me everything I need to try out my theories.

5:55pm. I am giddy right now. It's been a while since I've been engrossed in thinking like this.

Our Worst Market Week Ever — How We Make It Back x2

I am watching this as I prepare to go to bed, and am wondering once again why Chris has such a gambler's mentality. Double down bucket? Triple down bucket?

11:55pm. Why is he doing option trades on AMZN? Doesn't he have any infoarb trades to do?
 
The guy to the left says Chris is deep into margin.

Holy shit.

The AI bubble could easily pop and wipe him out.

12am. Let me stop at the 8m mark. Listening to Chris talk enrages me.

Look, there is nothing wrong just being 100% long and holding for the long term. But being on margin and holding long term is guaranteed to get you killed. Chris is going to find that out the hard way. Every gambler thinks that he is an exception and that risk management rules don't apply to him. They do.

2/7/2026

12:30pm. Let me get started with the SMB course videos. My sleeping pattern has changed during the past few days. I'd get up at 8 and go back to sleep only to get up at close to 12pm.

Which I guess is an improvement.

Right now my mindset is the same when I was working on Spiral. It such a fresh challenge.

1:25pm. Jan 2008 was the best trading market they've seen in 7 years.

2pm. Phew, done with day 2. So the held bids and offers the best trading ops according to them.

2:05pm. Let me take a short break and I'll continue to day 3.

ASTARTES 8K (Remastered)

I keep seeing Warhammer 40k vids on Youtube lately and it has gotten me curious.

3:45pm. Let me continue watching the course. Let's see if I can finish day 3 today.

4:10pm. ![](images/image-2058.png)

Lel. Let me go back to the vids. I've just finished one.

4:20pm. > When a stock gets good, it has a lot of volume. When a stock isn't trading it doesn't have a lot of volume.

Wisdom quote by Bella from 16 years ago.

4:30pm. ![](images/image-2059.png)

Here he is teaching me to get in front of a big offer, but otherwise get out if it goes away. Makes sense.

Yeah, it's not that trading is complicated, it's just that I completely got not even fooled, but defeated by randomness and my own laziness. This time around you can be sure I'll substitute my programming skill to make it a success.

All the edge in trading is learning to analyze order flow.

4:35pm. ![](images/image-2060.png)

He's teaching to get long in front of a big bid. It does go away the next moment though.

4:40pm. It's really hard to focus on both the tape and the inside market. I have no idea how these guys could possibly be capable of tracking the volume.

In fact, tracking numerical quantities is the hardest thing there is.

![](images/image-2061.png)

Damn, I cannot follow this at all. Does this guy have one eye on the inner market and the other on the tape? Things just change so fast.

![](images/image-2062.png)

He is telling me how he'd go in front of big bids and then hitting out if they got decremented.

So it's not just held bids or offers.

6pm. The talk about the inside market is really good.

> You really can get to know the patterns based on bids and offers.

He is talking about buying programs.

> Who's the buyer, who's the seller.

I've noticed that they look for that a lot, but I find it very hard to keep track of things on the box.

6:15pm. Done with day 3. Damn, all this is bad news for me because to be on par with those guys I am going to require full quote data which costs thousands of dollars per month.

I don't think I'll need it all at the start so I might be able to get away with less.

This is good reason to maybe try out crpto trading instead.

...Nevermind, let me stop watching lectures here for the day. The stuff I learned about the inside market is noteworthy.

Those guys are hawks. I might be able to get away with less by picking my setups better. Like, do what Lance teaches and fade euphoric moves at the right time.

Like the BTC collapse recently. I really want to look into those kinds of patterns.

Let me do some research on how easy it is to get data from crypto exchanges.

> I think that full order book data should be easier to get for crypto than for stocks given that they trade openly on the blockchain.  For perpetual futures trading, how much would it cost to get the full trade data that includes the aggressor side as well as full order book data for a particular time period? I think for stocks it would cost thousands of dollars per month. I haven't seen it offered to retail traders anywhere.

///

You're raising an interesting point, but there's actually a common misconception here worth unpacking.

**Crypto exchange order books ≠ blockchain data**

Most crypto trading — especially perpetual futures — happens on **centralized exchanges** (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, etc.), not on-chain. The order book, matching engine, and trade execution all live on the exchange's internal infrastructure, just like a stock exchange. The blockchain only gets involved for deposits/withdrawals. So the order book transparency isn't inherently better because of blockchain technology.

Even on DEXs like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid, the order book mechanics are off-chain or on an app-chain, not sitting transparently on Ethereum L1.

**That said, you're right that the data is vastly more accessible and cheaper.** But the reason isn't the blockchain — it's that crypto exchanges compete for retail flow and offer generous free APIs.

**What you can get for free or cheap:**

- **Real-time L2 order book snapshots** (typically top 5-20 levels) — free via WebSocket on Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.
- **Full depth order book** — Binance offers this free via WebSocket (`depth@100ms` or snapshot endpoints with up to 5000 levels)
- **Trade stream with aggressor side** — free on virtually every major exchange. Every trade message includes whether the taker was a buyer or seller (i.e., the aggressor flag). This is the equivalent of what you'd need expensive data for in equities.
- **Aggregated trades** — also free, which bundle fills at the same price/time/side

**For historical data:**

- **Binance** publishes historical trades and aggregated trades as free CSV downloads on their data portal (data.binance.vision). This includes the `is_buyer_maker` flag (aggressor side). Order book snapshots are also available.
- **Tardis.dev** — probably the gold standard for historical crypto market data. Full L2/L3 order book, trades with aggressor side, liquidations, funding rates, etc. Pricing starts around **$0–$50/month** for individual/research tiers, with pay-per-use options. Compare that to thousands/month for equivalent equity data.
- **CoinAPI, Kaiko, Amberdata** — institutional-grade providers, more expensive ($hundreds–$thousands/month), but still cheaper than equity equivalents and with more generous trial/free tiers.

**So for your use case specifically:**

If you wanted full trade data with aggressor side + order book snapshots for, say, BTC-USDT perpetual on Binance for a 6-month historical window, you could realistically get it for **$0–$100** through a combination of Binance's free data portal and Tardis.dev. In real-time, it's completely free via the exchange WebSocket APIs.

The equity world is expensive because exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE) treat market data as a revenue stream and charge heavily for it, especially for full depth-of-book feeds like ITCH/PITCH. Crypto exchanges took the opposite approach — data accessibility drives volume drives fee revenue.

Worth noting: the *quality* of crypto order book data is lower in some ways (more spoofing, wash trading, less regulatory oversight on data integrity), so keep that in mind if you're training models on it.

///

Nice. Opus gives me a lot of options for crypto trading. It might be good to start at these places.

6:40pm. ![](images/image-2063.png)

Actually Taris.dev is expensive as fuck.

> Taris.dev start at 700/month minimum. It's pretty expensive.

///

You're right, I should check the actual pricing rather than going from potentially outdated info. Let me look it up.Thanks for the correction. Tardis.dev's minimum order is $300 and their subscriptions are indeed in the hundreds per month range — not the cheap option I initially suggested.

Here's a more accurate picture of the landscape:

**Free options (the real story):**

Binance provides historical trades and aggTrades for free via data.binance.vision — these include the `is_buyer_maker` flag (aggressor side), so you get trade-level order flow for free. However, historical order book data for futures requires a Futures account and is restricted to VIP 1 or above users. So the trade data with aggressor side is free, but the full order book depth history is gated.

For real-time data, every major exchange gives you full depth order book + trade stream with aggressor side via WebSocket for free. The catch is you have to **collect and store it yourself** going forward — you can't go back in time.

**The DIY approach (actually $0):**

The most practical path for someone in your situation would be to start recording the data yourself now. Connect to Binance/Bybit perp WebSocket feeds, capture the L2 order book updates and trade stream, dump it into DuckDB or Parquet files. You'd have exactly the data you need within a few weeks/months of collection. The Tardis open-source `tardis-machine` library can help with normalized collection and is completely free to use for real-time data, connecting directly to exchanges' WebSocket APIs with no API key required.

**Paid historical options:**

- **Tardis.dev**: $300 minimum order for historical, subscriptions from there. Best quality according to most quants.
- **Crypto Lake** (crypto-lake.com): cheaper than Tardis but with less coverage — offers 20-level order book snapshots.
- **CCXT**: Free library for scraping normalized data from exchanges, though you're limited to what exchange REST APIs will give you historically.

You're right that it's still not trivially cheap for historical depth data. But the key difference from equities remains: you *can* collect it yourself for free going forward, and the trade data with aggressor labeling is genuinely free historically. For equities, even real-time depth-of-book feeds require expensive exchange subscriptions before you can even start recording.

///

Nevermind that for now. I need to know how the order book and the order flow behave.

7pm. > What is the SMB Capital Low Float Trade?

///

SMB Capital's **Low Float Trade** is a specific intraday trading setup taught by the proprietary trading firm SMB Capital (founded by Mike Bellafiore and Steve Spencer). Let me search for the most current details on this.Based on what I've found, SMB Capital actually teaches two related low float setups. The one most commonly referred to as **the** "Low Float Trade" is the **Low Float Reversal Trade** (sometimes just called the "Low Float Short" or "backside trade"). Here's how it works:

## The Setup

**Stock characteristics:**
- Stocks with less than ~10 million shares float, with a sweet spot around 5 million shares
- High short interest, often >20% of float
- These are typically low-priced, small-cap stocks that have experienced a parabolic run-up driven by promotion, news catalysts, or speculative momentum

**The Core Idea:**
SMB teaches traders to wait for the "backside of the trade" — staying away from the "front side" saves you from getting caught in a short squeeze and the potential for substantial trading losses. The "front side" is the parabolic move up (which is dangerous to short due to squeeze risk). The "backside" is where the stock has peaked and begins to reverse.

**Why it works:**
Low float stocks are not as competitive as other stocks, and thus easier to trade. When they reverse, the downmove is substantial and fast, with profits realized immediately. When they reverse, you can sit and hold a core position, making fewer trade decisions. Very little capital is necessary to take a very large position, and the risk/reward is enormous.

**The pattern repeats reliably:** These come every week, without fail, as there is a period of pump and then dump in these low float trades.

## How It's Traded

The general approach is:

1. **Identify** a low float stock that has had a parabolic run (often 50-200%+ in days)
2. **Wait** for the move to exhaust — look for the stock to fail at resistance, show declining volume on bounces, or break key intraday support levels
3. **Short the backside** once the reversal is confirmed, typically using VWAP, prior day levels, or intraday support breaks as entry triggers
4. **Manage risk tightly** — this trade requires extreme discipline and risk management given the wide spreads and potential for violent squeezes
5. **Hold a core position** as the stock unwinds, often over multiple days

## Key Nuance

SMB emphasizes this as a **short-side trade on the backside**, not trying to buy the pump or short into strength. The edge comes from patience — letting the overextended move play out and then capitalizing on the inevitable mean reversion in a stock with limited float and exhausted buying.

This ties directly into your interest in order flow analysis, Marko — the "unusual hold on bid/offer" patterns you're detecting could be very relevant for identifying when these low float names are being accumulated or distributed near turning points.

///

This is Tim's trade basically. On the Winning Trade course page they call it a favorite of beginning retail traders.

I myself like anything that is easy to spot.

I've been looking at some 1s charts of BTC and they have pretty smooth trends. But they are also mostly rangebound, and you can't really tell when the turns will come.

7:05pm. I am going to try to push through the entire course in the next week if possible so I can move on to programming. The sooner I can start scanning for setups the better. The sooner I can start studying the market the better. The sooner I can code up my insights the better. The sooner I can start making money the better.

I've thing I've realize from today's lectures is that I am really going to have to look into the order book in order to get a sense for the stocks' liquidity. Or rather my bot will. Whenever I take a position, I am going to have to look into easy it would be to get out if the market turns. It'd be terrible to take a position that's too large and get crushed.

Bella's definitely looking into order book imbalances when making trades. I wonder how I am going to model that?

They also look at very specific patterns. They recounted a pattern where the market would pop if there was a big buy order by JP Morgan below the bid. Some of their traders would trade that consistently for about a month.

One trade he talked about that sometimes happened is that there would be a big buyer on the bid, and then he would keep lifting the bid until it is exhausted.

If I just look at trades, I'd miss that completely.

You know, I don't have to bake everything into a NN model. I can have simpler rule based systems as well. We'll see.

But well, I did make the order book generator for a reason. I can simulate the order book imbalances using that.

If the move is strongly positive there should be an order book imbalance in some direction, right?

7:15pm. Sigh, this is really nice.

There is a challenge to this. And there is the possibility of a big win.

It's ironic that the easiest patterns (abnormal volume & tape speed, order book imbalances, held levels) to detect are also ones that are more likely to be long lasting. Patterns that require deep reads of the market like with that JPM bid, are the ones that are likely to be transient.

I really like that the 16 year old SMB course is all about tape reading. The Trader DNA and the Winning Trader courses aren't about that.

...You know what, once I push through this course, and get my fill, I'll get the tape reading course as well for 30$ off Yandex. It's a more up to date course and could be a great investment for that sum.

7:25pm. ![](images/image-2064.png)

Oh lol, Opus accidentally found the Winning Trader course pirated on this site. I myself only ever found the Tape Reading one on Yandex.

![](images/image-2065.png)

Here is the Trader DNA one as well.

Damn, now I actually found a torrent for the SMB Tape Reading course on [LimeTorrents](https://www.limetorrents.fun/). It's downloading as we speak. It's only 2.7Gb large.

...It stalled at 97% of all things. At any rate, I should be able to download it tomorrow. I guess I'll change my plans a little.

![](images/image-2066.png)

Also GigaCourses has the two SMB courses for cheap as well. Ok.

7:40pm. I didn't expect I'd be able to find the Tape Reading course today. It's annoying that it stalled at 97%, but if it can finish then...should I drop the Foundation course and move on to the tape reading one.

But the Foundation course is pretty much a tape reading course as it is so I am getting what I want either way.

2/8/2026

10:45am. Every hour I put into Patfinder worsens my sleep by some %.

11:20am. Let me get started for today. Let me resume the tape reading course torrent.

Forget gaming. Instead obsess. Obsess like you did about Spiral. Obsess like you did about the old projects. That is the way to build up skill.

Sigh, the tape reading course has no seeds and seems to be stuck at 97%.

11:30am. Ok, if I cannot download it the whole day today I'll just shell out 30$ to get it outright. It got 97% of it in a couple of minutes, and now I am finding waiting hours for it to get that last 3%.
