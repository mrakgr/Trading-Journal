# Overview

I like how unlike in git commit messages I can also insert images in the markdown. I'll be using this for my journaling needs.

Initially, this repo started as a trading journal, but As of mid September I've started using it as a regular one. Currently I've gone back to working on the poker bot and am gearing up to start work on the **Hopfield Dictionary Preliminaries**. But if you're looking for trading strategy ideas, it has a fair amount strewn throughout the various posts. I'd heartily recommend looking into Stockbee, Qullamaggie, SMC Capital and Lance Breitstein. After I am done with poker whenever that might be, I'll likely come back to trading.
