10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

Trade of the month. One day I'll be capable of catching them.

More data centers in space nonsense. I thought it was a joke by Bezos, but Elon is now seriously pushing it.
