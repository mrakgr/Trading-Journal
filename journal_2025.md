10:10am. In order to help ensure discipline in my trading, I've decided according to my usual style to open a public trading journal.

Because of my work with Tao Ceti, I am too busy to spend monologuing in the Spiral language or the ML library repo, and I am probably being a nuisance posting stock market & trading related messages in the company's Discord channel. It's not a big deal since there are only 2 other guys there, but I doubt they are interested in this, so I should move that kind of posting in its proper place.

I've been considering various avenues to improve my trading.

One option would be to put some effort into actually understanding what I am trading, so I am considering learning finance and economics. There should be good courses on these subjects like on platforms like Coursera or Udacity. I should also start doing fundamental research. But I am skeptical of those approaches to getting better for reasons I will get into later.

Over the past week I've had many days when I've been stressed out due to the market specifically, and had trouble sleeping. Being tired the next day has been impacting my performance at work negatively. And it's not really pleasant to be awake a couple of nights in a row because my brain is simply refusing to switch off and get some rest, even though I was lying in bed.

I've started trading 3 months ago, and my holding periods are long so there haven't been many of them, so I'll be going over them later. But for now, let me start with the most important part of this repo which is describing my trading methodology. I'll do that in a separate file.

8:25pm. I'll do the analysis later as I am really tired from writing that [large document](/methodology.md). Hopefully this will allow me to reach catharsis. I just want to get this out so I can sleep well during the night.

I wish I could just tell my brain to take a break, but that isn't how it works for me.

Sheridan Titman On His Seminal Paper on Momentum Investing and What He Has Learned Since

Watching this video and he says some very interesting things like that momentum actually works better the more efficient the market is. It works best in the US, but in Japan or China it doesn't.

Will work on trade analysis during the weekend. Don't feel like it during my workdays.

So far the week did start out pretty challenging. I absolutely must hold this week and the next 3. As scary as the market is now, it's much more dangerous to sell out early than late.

7/2/2025

9:40am. I got up early today I started wondering about Japanese stocks and whether what Sheridan said was true.

So what I've been doing for the past hour is going over the stock charts of all the Japanese stocks sorted by 6 month momentum, and I cannot find even a single one worth trading.

The 8-week uptrend rule simply doesn't work, the momentum stocks just spike and then sit there for months. They also generally have huge and sudden declines, and have wild swings all over the place. There is no trend, they just pierce. So I think he is right.

I am sure that if I only had the Tokyo market to trade, I might as well retire.

I didn't realize at all how much my method is dependant on liquidity. It does seem to be the case that the more efficient the market is, the better it works. Japan needs a proper bull market to draw the money into it.

Given the lesson, I think the top down approach is even more important than I thought. There is a bull market is europe which will make my methods work well. Having the money come into the market is what is needed for liquidity, which should ameliorate the wild swings we see in Tokyo stocks.

10:10pm. Finally the workdays are over. I'll do some trade analysis starting tomorrow.

Buying Winning Stocks Through Momentum Investing w/ Wes Gray (MI140)

Interesting interview. He says that companies with good price action have a fundamentally cheaper access to capital which improves their fundamentals.

https://youtu.be/robBbj7jZFo?t=1312
> The US is the greatest survivor bias experiment of all time.

https://youtu.be/robBbj7jZFo?t=1832
> The minute you try to impose quality or valuation, anything that smells like a value investor was involved, you're just going to ruin the momentum strategy.

This interview on momentum is by a value guy who mechanised it. It's pretty interesting.

https://youtu.be/robBbj7jZFo?t=2889
> It's a total value dog because it's just so cheap on cash flow basis and the expectations were so terrible, but those guys couldn't get out of their own way trying to raise capital to help them out. All of a sudden, they go on a short squeeze, price action goes bonkers and because they can raise capital for like negative cost to capital it seems...I don't know if that a concept...now they're like fundamentally in a better position as a business than they've ever been in the history of their lives! Just because of price action!

I wonder what the Strategy 33 Model is doing. Right now I am just watching financial videos and looking at charts. I meant to continue the analysis from last week, but ended up doing what I want instead.

I'll finish this video and then resume.

3pm. Let me do some work on the analysis. Enough watching vids.

I find this investment philosophy very interesting. Based on what he is saying I should have invested in Nvidia, though at that point I had no money to invest and had thrown in the towel.

Reading this makes me realize that I was wrong about not being connected to anything. I have my own narrow circle of competence due to my work as a software engineer.

Token - Maple Financial

I'll go into what these two mean later. Logris showed me an example of amazing earnings acceleration that led the price rise in Maple Financial. He made a mistake of not betting big on this opportunity in my view.

How to Build a Trend Following System | Interview with Tom Basso | Hedge Fund Manager

He is saying that buy and sell decisions aren't as important as beginners think they are.

Yeah, I think I need to loosen up.

I've been thinking about my trading going forward and if the current positive price action continues into the end of next week, I am going to buy RHM in order to increase my exposure to it. The ETF only has 10% in it, but I'd like if it were higher. Bringing it up to 20% by buying shares of it directly should do the trick.

I need to loosen up. I did a good job by trading my portfolio in pieces and I should continue that. Every two weeks I should be increasing or decreasing instead of standing still.

Doing this move would only change my long exposure from 101 to 110% and after I get paid from my job, the margin would get paid down to 100%.

I do want to start phasing out my ETF trading in favor of trading stocks directly. I am not going to be adding any more to my ETF positions.

Ironically, I think the way I've been trading ETFs now is how I'll trade when I am much bigger. But right now I am just throwing away alpha.

To be honest, the line between beta and alpha is blurred to me. Beta is alpha during bull markets.

God, I wish I had Jeffrey Neumann's insight. He is to trading what Elon Musk is to entrepreneurship. I was never envious of other traders until I read his interview in the newest Market Wizards book.

They are both lucksacks, but unlike Elon whose past successes seem like a fluke now, Jeffrey has the intelligence to match his success.

I am reminded of Ed Seykota's quote that it's rare that nature provides the ability to meet a burning desire in a person.

10pm. I've decided. I think at the end of next week, I am going to sell down my DEFS position in order to make room for RHM.

I want to bring up my exposure in that stock up to 25% at least. Then in two weeks I am going to sell it to make room for something else, and that way I am going to wean myself off ETFs and into individual market leaders.

I told myself I wasn't going to do it, but deep down I know that I need to do this at some point and I might as well do it 'now'. By 'now' I mean, every two weeks. 

10:05pm. There are a lot of stocks going up right now, but if I want to be successful, I should avoid random individual momentum and trade themes.

There are 3 major ones and 1 minor (East Europe) in play currently.

1) Defense stocks.
2) AI.
3) Crypto.
4) East Europe - Croatia and Slovenia.

It's not just European defense stocks, for some reason South Korea is going crazy and there are a ton of momentum picks in that market.

AI is mostly Nvidia, but it has some stocks on its tails like CoreWeave. I think that 2-3 months down the road once it digest the rapid runup, I am probably going to be buying it.

Crypto is mostly Bitcoin. It seems like it's close to breaking out, but I want to give it 3 weeks in order to see how it acts around the breakout point.

In Croatia where I live there is a lot of inflation and the stock markets of Crotia and Slovenia have burst from 1.5 decade long consolidations. Reminds me of China and the emerging markets in the 00s. Back then it also made a huge move.

Too bad I didn't buy this instead of the euro ETFs or ASWC.

I need to pay more attention from here on out.

I just checked in IB, and I am restricted buying due to dumb European regulations. But maybe these regulations are doing me a favor. I really should be trading individual stocks instead of ETFs. ETFs are filled with laggards which will drag down my performance long term.

10:25pm. As an aside, here are some pullbacks that are good buying opportunities on my watchlist.

![ZS](images/image-40.png)
![NET](images/image-41.png)
![DAVE](images/image-42.png)

These are opportunities to buy momentum stocks at a better price point, but what makes them opportunities is that I stretched out my holding period to a minimum of two weeks.

I think the realization that I have to be operating at a 2 - 12 week timescales and move gradually in 2 week steps is the most important insight from my 6 years of failed trading and 11 years of absence. More than smart, I must be patient.

You can make a lot of money in stocks just by holding them for 1-3 months irrespective of patterns.

The market has a strong long bias and I simply didn't appreciate that at all. I simply didn't.

I need to sense the themes, and I need to rotate into the leaders. Then I have to hold and be on the looking for momentum pettering out on the 8 week scale in the leaders. If I can just watch the leaders, they will tell me when the market has topped.

If you're looking at the SPY, it's very hard to know what is happening, but when you see stocks that usually go up 30% per month stop doing that it's very much obvious.

I don't need a mechanical system like in the Janus factor book. I can tell what the themes are just by looking at the stocks themselves.
