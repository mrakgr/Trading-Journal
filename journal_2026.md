10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

5pm. ![](images/image-2039.png)

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

![](images/image-2041.png)

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

![](images/image-2042.png)

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

![](images/image-2043.png)

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

1/29/2026

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

More data centers in space nonsense. I thought it was a joke by Bezos, but Elon is now seriously pushing it.

The Nightmare.

7:45pm. I guess this week it's another downleg in the market. Gold and silver dumped, and BTC is now solidly below 80k.

I myself am done making simplistic models. I need to move on to making realistic ones.

The plan is to take a break from programming and go through the SMB Capital course that I downloaded a while ago.

I need to start baking in actual order flow patterns into the generative model. Swapping between episodes is very obvious.

8:50pm. I'll slow down my pace and think more carefully how I want to do modeling.

In efficient markets it's hard to do trend following. The patterns where drift/volatility is greater than 0.1 is rare.

Most of the patterns are volatility with no drift.

9:05pm. Starting tomorrow, I am going to slow down. Yeah, just programming isn't going to get me far. I need to start studying again.

I know 1 pattern which is the held bid/offer, but there have to be other ones. I need to get everything I can from SMB.

Then I will try coding it up into a coherent system. If it turns out that tape reading absolutely cannot be distilled into a neural network then so be it. I'll apologize to Thomas for misleading him again (the first time was the Hopfield dictionary) and move on to something else.

The 107k I have lying around is permission for me to put the try this. If I am not going to do it now then when?

Ok, so price patterns on 1s charts are one thing, but there could very well be differences when I look into actual order flow, especially at extreme situations.

2:25pm. Here is what it takes to get hired at SMB.

* 100 trades in the last 60 trading sessions.
* Winners bigger than losses.
* Going through the SMB Training.

https://payment.smbtraining.com/smbspecial/trainingcamp-re.php

4k price tags. I don't have enough in my bank account even if I wanted to. I'll leave it for later.

I am going to focus on the old course, and if I am having success with that I'll definitely go through the main one even if it means paying 2-4k in fees. Because if I could attain profitability it would be worth it. Right now it isn't.

Who knows whether shelling out money for this is right or not, but either way it will take me time to build up a track record and make these systems. I am not in a hurry. Let me start with day 2 from the old course and I'll go from there.

2:30pm. Let me do the chores and then I will get started with the course.

![](images/image-2052.png)

I wonder if the dumbass founders are still long this shit or if they've bailed earlier? I bet BTC is very scary to hold for many people right now. Stock indices just refuse to collapse though despite the fundamentals getting worse and worse.

The Killer Mistake to Avoid at All Costs

Let me watch this.

I am trying to figure out what my goals are. I thought about the opening plays and yes, that is what I want to do. Forget generating the whole day, I'll cut out everything, but the first hour and focus solely on that to start off.

My beginner's strategy will be to focus only on the first hour. I'll generate some consolidations and some opening drives and focus solely on that.

The random price action model is quite powerful. I can take advantage of deviations from it.

As I go through the SMB course, I will focus just on that, the opening drive.

4:10pm. Let me start going through the course. This will take me a while.

4:15pm. ![](images/image-2053.png)

This is my first time seeing Brett Steenbarger talk. I used to read just blog a lot back in the day.

> You want to trade with a microscope - that's the tape, and trade with the telescope, that's the big picture.
> I want to be my goals, not just have goals! Do you see the difference? Too many people have goals, like you have a car, you have a goal. It's something separate from you.
> And finally the best goals are based on strengths, on what do well.

Great talk and I am already halfway in.

4:45pm. Balance vs imbalance. I think I understand it now. Balance is when drift < volatility. When it's below 0.1 the noise dominates the drift. And when it's the opposite That is when you breakouts. In the market, I find that it goes between extremes.

I'll really want to get my hands on trade sides and study those in nuance.

I think I need to introduce a concept. A trade can be highly probable to hit the bid or the ask, but at the same time when you have absorbtions or held levels, those levels tend to hold. In other words, in breakouts to the upside, the bids should be holding. Volume on the bid shouldn't drop the price, but volume on the ask should lead to the levels rising.

And in absorbtion, strong momentum to the upside where trades are mostly getting executed on the ask will start having difficulty pushing prices up.

The model I have now doesn't represent this well.

4:55pm. Yeah, this is a major weakness of my modeling effort.

I need to model the passive and aggresive flow and the interplay between them.

5pm. The sooner I start thinking about the bids and the asks the better. I have to admit the experiments really made me realize just how the drift and volatility components interact.

Let me finish the video instead of falling into thought here.

5:30pm. ![](images/image-2054.png)

Watching this again. He says the downside is 1-2 pennies and the upside is 30-100 cents for unusual holds on the bid.

Yeah, this is what I want.

Imagine if I was a big buyer. I'd start off accumulating slowly and then stepping up once the level has been exhausted. I just need to look for those kinds of patterns, but at the same time I want to see all of SMB's setups, at least from that time.

I need to model this and the order book to a simplified degree.

6:20pm. ![](images/image-2055.png)

Today I learned about coming back to the bid pattern. 

6:25pm. I'll stop here for the day. It's going to be hell to bake all of this into the model. I am going to learn to both read the tape and model quantitatively.

This is only day 2 and the course is 25 days long so I have my work cut out for me.

I wonder why in the later courses they put less of an emphasis on tape reading? Do the retail fish traders not like it?

Who knows, maybe it's this course that I actually need rather than the up to date versions. It's all tape reading.

Let's see if I can maintain a pace of 1 day of the course per real life day.

9:25pm. ![BTCUSD](images/image-2056.png)

Bitcoin is absolutely melting. If this doesn't crush the markets eventually, I don't know what will. The indices just refuse to go down.

![QQQ](images/image-2057.png)

I mean, it is going down, but it's still solidly above April lows.

2/6/2026

5:45pm. I'll consider today a vacation. This really bring me to the old Spiral days when I was engrossed in my thoughts the whole day.

I have a bunch of a good ideas that I wrote in an email to Thomas. Here is a segment of it:

///

I've had some inspiration over the night about this which is making me feel more hopeful. A plan is coming together for me.

First, I don't think it's possible to emulate the reasoning that discretionary tape reading traders do with NNs. Another thing I am realizing is that my generative models won't be good when it comes to modeling realistic order flow. Another issue is that the most realistic price action so far is the one that is generated by completely random models (with no drift).

But now I've had a realization that if the market really is random, then it has to be random at the level of individual trades. So an experiment is coming to mind. If I train a NN on my synthetic moves and let is label the price of Bitcoin for example, would it conclude that the entire thing was generated from a completely random distribution, or will the network detect individual episodes which have positive and negative drift.

If there is a strong uptrending move that has lasted for a few minutes for example, there will be a large difference between it being generated by a distribution with a strong drift relative to volatility and a distribution with no drift and high volatility, even though it might look the same on a chart. I've realized that even if I am using 1s charts, that might obscure the underlying pattern.

It's very weird. This is something that only ever occurred to me now that I am creating generative models. The basic problem is that if have numerous distributions with different drift and volatility components, how can I prevent the NN from telling them apart purely based on volatility of individual trades? And the truth is that it's probably impossible. When I add the trade aggresor fields, it's going to be even easier. Adding trade sizes in the latest iteration already makes it very obvious when an episode has changed because the new episode has different volume patterns. But if that is how it is in simulated settings, what does that imply for real life ones? It never over occurred to me to think along these lines.

One great idea that I've had last night is that I could have the NN labels the moves it sees in real life data, and I could then use real life occurrences of those moves to adjust the generative model, which could make the model even more precise after it has been retrained on the updated model.

///

Some of the recent insights are completely changing the way I look at price action, and I am blown away by them.

If this really works, it could be huge. I'll finally be able to understand how the markets really work.

I really need to go through the SMB course and then I will put them to the test. SMB will give the nuances I might miss in my theoretic modeling.

I am also considering going into crypto because the high quality data is cheap there and gives me everything I need to try out my theories.

5:55pm. I am giddy right now. It's been a while since I've been engrossed in thinking like this.

Our Worst Market Week Ever — How We Make It Back x2

I am watching this as I prepare to go to bed, and am wondering once again why Chris has such a gambler's mentality. Double down bucket? Triple down bucket?

11:55pm. Why is he doing option trades on AMZN? Doesn't he have any infoarb trades to do?
 
The guy to the left says Chris is deep into margin.

Holy shit.

The AI bubble could easily pop and wipe him out.

12am. Let me stop at the 8m mark. Listening to Chris talk enrages me.

Look, there is nothing wrong just being 100% long and holding for the long term. But being on margin and holding long term is guaranteed to get you killed. Chris is going to find that out the hard way. Every gambler thinks that he is an exception and that risk management rules don't apply to him. They do.

12:30pm. Let me get started with the SMB course videos. My sleeping pattern has changed during the past few days. I'd get up at 8 and go back to sleep only to get up at close to 12pm.

Which I guess is an improvement.

Right now my mindset is the same when I was working on Spiral. It such a fresh challenge.

1:25pm. Jan 2008 was the best trading market they've seen in 7 years.

2pm. Phew, done with day 2. So the held bids and offers the best trading ops according to them.

2:05pm. Let me take a short break and I'll continue to day 3.

I keep seeing Warhammer 40k vids on Youtube lately and it has gotten me curious.

3:45pm. Let me continue watching the course. Let's see if I can finish day 3 today.

Lel. Let me go back to the vids. I've just finished one.
