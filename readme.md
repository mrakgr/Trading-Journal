# Overview

I like how unlike in git commit messages I can also insert images in the markdown. I'll be using this for my journaling needs.

Here are the core drills from Jigsaw Trading as summarized by Opus:

///

**Core Drills:**

1. **Cut and Reverse Drill** (also called "Always in the Market")
   - Take a 1-contract position and stay in the market for 60-90 minutes
   - You can never go flat — only reverse your position when you sense flow is changing
   - Builds ability to read market flow and recognize when to exit bad trades
   - Do at least 10 sessions, 1-2 per day

2. **One Tick Drill**
   - Goal: enter and exit with just 1 tick profit, repeatedly
   - The tiny target forces you to focus purely on entries
   - Trade frequently — prop firms target 70+ trades per day
   - Builds pattern recognition for optimal entry points

3. **Trading Naked**
   - Trade using only a stripped-down DOM (no charts, no indicators)
   - Just market depth bids/offers and accumulated trades at price
   - Develops understanding of the auction process and order flow

**Additional Exercises Mentioned:**

- Fade iceberg orders/absorption areas
- Look for pulling on one side and stacking on the other
- Establish short-term ranges and scalp both sides
- Practice around economic news releases using replay software

The progression typically runs: overwhelming first few weeks → recognizing obvious flow changes → developing intuition for market pace → skills transferring to regular trading. The course emphasizes doing these in simulation, not live, and includes replay software to practice specific order flow patterns across different market conditions.

Trading Order Flow: Keeping It Simple, Practical & Effective

I am really into order flow now, and even going through the SMB Capital course. I found this really good video on their channel. Much of their day 1 content has to do with reading the tape or the trades executed directly.

OrderFlow Series

Carmine Rosato's order flow series is amazing and is the best educational resource out of all those linked thus far. I really understand the power of volume deltas now. The way he contrasts the information the DOM and the footprint charts with that of candlestick charts is simply divine. Unfortunately, it generally kills the model I proposed in the intro video to [Building The Trading Edge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL04PGV4cTuIXoK6yBAFzhgBYq0uMCfeNo).

The Ultimate Guide to PRO Trading

This video by Andrea Cimitan lives up to its name. Since Hopfield dictionaries failed, I'll be going into trading. It really hurts to drop poker, but I want to take some time to work on trading systems. I think I would have enjoyed hand crafting the cost functions if I put my mind to it. I'll make up for it by applying the process to trading instead.

[Bookmap](https://bookmap.com/learning-center/en) has a number of good tutorials. In particular check the 4 part course starting with the [order flow video](https://youtu.be/3m_Stn4hxCQ).

Hopfield Dictionary CFR

Here is the new Spiral playlist. I'll do the games in C++ on the host as well.

Initially, this repo started as a trading journal, but since mid September I've also started using it as a regular one. Currently I've gone back to working on the poker bot and am gearing up to start work on the **Hopfield Dictionary CFR Preliminaries**. But if you're looking for trading strategy ideas, it has a fair amount strewn throughout the various posts. I'd recommend looking into [Stockbee](https://www.youtube.com/@Stockbeevideos) and [Qullamaggie](https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/) for swing trading, [SMB Capital](https://www.youtube.com/@smbcapital) and [Lance Breitstein](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOneLanceB) for daytrading. After I am done with poker whenever that might be, I'll likely come back to trading.

Compared to 2007 - 2014 when I was last active as a trader, there are amazingly good learning resources on the Internet if you can sift through the fakers.
