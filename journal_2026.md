10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

![](images/image-2038.png)

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

5pm. ![](images/image-2039.png)

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

![](images/image-2040.png)
> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

![](images/image-2041.png)

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

![](images/image-2042.png)

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

![](images/image-2043.png)

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

1/29/2026

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

The Nightmare.

7:45pm. I guess this week it's another downleg in the market. Gold and silver dumped, and BTC is now solidly below 80k.

I myself am done making simplistic models. I need to move on to making realistic ones.

The plan is to take a break from programming and go through the SMB Capital course that I downloaded a while ago.

I need to start baking in actual order flow patterns into the generative model. Swapping between episodes is very obvious.

8:50pm. I'll slow down my pace and think more carefully how I want to do modeling.

In efficient markets it's hard to do trend following. The patterns where drift/volatility is greater than 0.1 is rare.

Most of the patterns are volatility with no drift.

9:05pm. Starting tomorrow, I am going to slow down. Yeah, just programming isn't going to get me far. I need to start studying again.

I know 1 pattern which is the held bid/offer, but there have to be other ones. I need to get everything I can from SMB.

Then I will try coding it up into a coherent system. If it turns out that tape reading absolutely cannot be distilled into a neural network then so be it. I'll apologize to Thomas for misleading him again (the first time was the Hopfield dictionary) and move on to something else.

The 107k I have lying around is permission for me to put the try this. If I am not going to do it now then when?

Ok, so price patterns on 1s charts are one thing, but there could very well be differences when I look into actual order flow, especially at extreme situations.

2:25pm. Here is what it takes to get hired at SMB.

* 100 trades in the last 60 trading sessions.
* Winners bigger than losses.
* Going through the SMB Training.

https://payment.smbtraining.com/smbspecial/trainingcamp-re.php

4k price tags. I don't have enough in my bank account even if I wanted to. I'll leave it for later.

I am going to focus on the old course, and if I am having success with that I'll definitely go through the main one even if it means paying 2-4k in fees. Because if I could attain profitability it would be worth it. Right now it isn't.

Who knows whether shelling out money for this is right or not, but either way it will take me time to build up a track record and make these systems. I am not in a hurry. Let me start with day 2 from the old course and I'll go from there.

2:30pm. Let me do the chores and then I will get started with the course.

![](images/image-2052.png)

I wonder if the dumbass founders are still long this shit or if they've bailed earlier? I bet BTC is very scary to hold for many people right now. Stock indices just refuse to collapse though despite the fundamentals getting worse and worse.

The Killer Mistake to Avoid at All Costs

Let me watch this.

I am trying to figure out what my goals are. I thought about the opening plays and yes, that is what I want to do. Forget generating the whole day, I'll cut out everything, but the first hour and focus solely on that to start off.

My beginner's strategy will be to focus only on the first hour. I'll generate some consolidations and some opening drives and focus solely on that.

The random price action model is quite powerful. I can take advantage of deviations from it.

As I go through the SMB course, I will focus just on that, the opening drive.

4:10pm. Let me start going through the course. This will take me a while.

4:15pm. ![](images/image-2053.png)

This is my first time seeing Brett Steenbarger talk. I used to read just blog a lot back in the day.

> You want to trade with a microscope - that's the tape, and trade with the telescope, that's the big picture.
> I want to be my goals, not just have goals! Do you see the difference? Too many people have goals, like you have a car, you have a goal. It's something separate from you.
> And finally the best goals are based on strengths, on what do well.

Great talk and I am already halfway in.

4:45pm. Balance vs imbalance. I think I understand it now. Balance is when drift < volatility. When it's below 0.1 the noise dominates the drift. And when it's the opposite That is when you breakouts. In the market, I find that it goes between extremes.

I'll really want to get my hands on trade sides and study those in nuance.

I think I need to introduce a concept. A trade can be highly probable to hit the bid or the ask, but at the same time when you have absorbtions or held levels, those levels tend to hold. In other words, in breakouts to the upside, the bids should be holding. Volume on the bid shouldn't drop the price, but volume on the ask should lead to the levels rising.

And in absorbtion, strong momentum to the upside where trades are mostly getting executed on the ask will start having difficulty pushing prices up.

The model I have now doesn't represent this well.

4:55pm. Yeah, this is a major weakness of my modeling effort.

I need to model the passive and aggresive flow and the interplay between them.

5pm. The sooner I start thinking about the bids and the asks the better. I have to admit the experiments really made me realize just how the drift and volatility components interact.

Let me finish the video instead of falling into thought here.

5:30pm. ![](images/image-2054.png)

Watching this again. He says the downside is 1-2 pennies and the upside is 30-100 cents for unusual holds on the bid.

Yeah, this is what I want.

Imagine if I was a big buyer. I'd start off accumulating slowly and then stepping up once the level has been exhausted. I just need to look for those kinds of patterns, but at the same time I want to see all of SMB's setups, at least from that time.

I need to model this and the order book to a simplified degree.

6:20pm. ![](images/image-2055.png)

Today I learned about coming back to the bid pattern. 

6:25pm. I'll stop here for the day. It's going to be hell to bake all of this into the model. I am going to learn to both read the tape and model quantitatively.

This is only day 2 and the course is 25 days long so I have my work cut out for me.

I wonder why in the later courses they put less of an emphasis on tape reading? Do the retail fish traders not like it?

Who knows, maybe it's this course that I actually need rather than the up to date versions. It's all tape reading.

Let's see if I can maintain a pace of 1 day of the course per real life day.

9:25pm. ![BTCUSD](images/image-2056.png)

Bitcoin is absolutely melting. If this doesn't crush the markets eventually, I don't know what will. The indices just refuse to go down.

![QQQ](images/image-2057.png)

I mean, it is going down, but it's still solidly above April lows.

2/6/2026

5:45pm. I'll consider today a vacation. This really bring me to the old Spiral days when I was engrossed in my thoughts the whole day.

I have a bunch of a good ideas that I wrote in an email to Thomas. Here is a segment of it:

///

I've had some inspiration over the night about this which is making me feel more hopeful. A plan is coming together for me.

First, I don't think it's possible to emulate the reasoning that discretionary tape reading traders do with NNs. Another thing I am realizing is that my generative models won't be good when it comes to modeling realistic order flow. Another issue is that the most realistic price action so far is the one that is generated by completely random models (with no drift).

But now I've had a realization that if the market really is random, then it has to be random at the level of individual trades. So an experiment is coming to mind. If I train a NN on my synthetic moves and let is label the price of Bitcoin for example, would it conclude that the entire thing was generated from a completely random distribution, or will the network detect individual episodes which have positive and negative drift.

If there is a strong uptrending move that has lasted for a few minutes for example, there will be a large difference between it being generated by a distribution with a strong drift relative to volatility and a distribution with no drift and high volatility, even though it might look the same on a chart. I've realized that even if I am using 1s charts, that might obscure the underlying pattern.

It's very weird. This is something that only ever occurred to me now that I am creating generative models. The basic problem is that if have numerous distributions with different drift and volatility components, how can I prevent the NN from telling them apart purely based on volatility of individual trades? And the truth is that it's probably impossible. When I add the trade aggresor fields, it's going to be even easier. Adding trade sizes in the latest iteration already makes it very obvious when an episode has changed because the new episode has different volume patterns. But if that is how it is in simulated settings, what does that imply for real life ones? It never over occurred to me to think along these lines.

One great idea that I've had last night is that I could have the NN labels the moves it sees in real life data, and I could then use real life occurrences of those moves to adjust the generative model, which could make the model even more precise after it has been retrained on the updated model.

///

Some of the recent insights are completely changing the way I look at price action, and I am blown away by them.

If this really works, it could be huge. I'll finally be able to understand how the markets really work.

I really need to go through the SMB course and then I will put them to the test. SMB will give the nuances I might miss in my theoretic modeling.

I am also considering going into crypto because the high quality data is cheap there and gives me everything I need to try out my theories.

5:55pm. I am giddy right now. It's been a while since I've been engrossed in thinking like this.

Our Worst Market Week Ever — How We Make It Back x2

I am watching this as I prepare to go to bed, and am wondering once again why Chris has such a gambler's mentality. Double down bucket? Triple down bucket?

11:55pm. Why is he doing option trades on AMZN? Doesn't he have any infoarb trades to do?
 
The guy to the left says Chris is deep into margin.

Holy shit.

The AI bubble could easily pop and wipe him out.

12am. Let me stop at the 8m mark. Listening to Chris talk enrages me.

Look, there is nothing wrong just being 100% long and holding for the long term. But being on margin and holding long term is guaranteed to get you killed. Chris is going to find that out the hard way. Every gambler thinks that he is an exception and that risk management rules don't apply to him. They do.

2/7/2026

12:30pm. Let me get started with the SMB course videos. My sleeping pattern has changed during the past few days. I'd get up at 8 and go back to sleep only to get up at close to 12pm.

Which I guess is an improvement.

Right now my mindset is the same when I was working on Spiral. It such a fresh challenge.

1:25pm. Jan 2008 was the best trading market they've seen in 7 years.

2pm. Phew, done with day 2. So the held bids and offers the best trading ops according to them.

2:05pm. Let me take a short break and I'll continue to day 3.

ASTARTES 8K (Remastered)

I keep seeing Warhammer 40k vids on Youtube lately and it has gotten me curious.

3:45pm. Let me continue watching the course. Let's see if I can finish day 3 today.

4:10pm. ![](images/image-2058.png)

Lel. Let me go back to the vids. I've just finished one.

4:20pm. > When a stock gets good, it has a lot of volume. When a stock isn't trading it doesn't have a lot of volume.

Wisdom quote by Bella from 16 years ago.

4:30pm. ![](images/image-2059.png)

Here he is teaching me to get in front of a big offer, but otherwise get out if it goes away. Makes sense.

Yeah, it's not that trading is complicated, it's just that I completely got not even fooled, but defeated by randomness and my own laziness. This time around you can be sure I'll substitute my programming skill to make it a success.

All the edge in trading is learning to analyze order flow.

4:35pm. ![](images/image-2060.png)

He's teaching to get long in front of a big bid. It does go away the next moment though.

4:40pm. It's really hard to focus on both the tape and the inside market. I have no idea how these guys could possibly be capable of tracking the volume.

In fact, tracking numerical quantities is the hardest thing there is.

![](images/image-2061.png)

Damn, I cannot follow this at all. Does this guy have one eye on the inner market and the other on the tape? Things just change so fast.

![](images/image-2062.png)

He is telling me how he'd go in front of big bids and then hitting out if they got decremented.

So it's not just held bids or offers.

6pm. The talk about the inside market is really good.

> You really can get to know the patterns based on bids and offers.

He is talking about buying programs.

> Who's the buyer, who's the seller.

I've noticed that they look for that a lot, but I find it very hard to keep track of things on the box.

6:15pm. Done with day 3. Damn, all this is bad news for me because to be on par with those guys I am going to require full quote data which costs thousands of dollars per month.

I don't think I'll need it all at the start so I might be able to get away with less.

This is good reason to maybe try out crpto trading instead.

...Nevermind, let me stop watching lectures here for the day. The stuff I learned about the inside market is noteworthy.

Those guys are hawks. I might be able to get away with less by picking my setups better. Like, do what Lance teaches and fade euphoric moves at the right time.

Like the BTC collapse recently. I really want to look into those kinds of patterns.

Let me do some research on how easy it is to get data from crypto exchanges.

> I think that full order book data should be easier to get for crypto than for stocks given that they trade openly on the blockchain.  For perpetual futures trading, how much would it cost to get the full trade data that includes the aggressor side as well as full order book data for a particular time period? I think for stocks it would cost thousands of dollars per month. I haven't seen it offered to retail traders anywhere.

///

You're raising an interesting point, but there's actually a common misconception here worth unpacking.

**Crypto exchange order books ≠ blockchain data**

Most crypto trading — especially perpetual futures — happens on **centralized exchanges** (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, etc.), not on-chain. The order book, matching engine, and trade execution all live on the exchange's internal infrastructure, just like a stock exchange. The blockchain only gets involved for deposits/withdrawals. So the order book transparency isn't inherently better because of blockchain technology.

Even on DEXs like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid, the order book mechanics are off-chain or on an app-chain, not sitting transparently on Ethereum L1.

**That said, you're right that the data is vastly more accessible and cheaper.** But the reason isn't the blockchain — it's that crypto exchanges compete for retail flow and offer generous free APIs.

**What you can get for free or cheap:**

- **Real-time L2 order book snapshots** (typically top 5-20 levels) — free via WebSocket on Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.
- **Full depth order book** — Binance offers this free via WebSocket (`depth@100ms` or snapshot endpoints with up to 5000 levels)
- **Trade stream with aggressor side** — free on virtually every major exchange. Every trade message includes whether the taker was a buyer or seller (i.e., the aggressor flag). This is the equivalent of what you'd need expensive data for in equities.
- **Aggregated trades** — also free, which bundle fills at the same price/time/side

**For historical data:**

- **Binance** publishes historical trades and aggregated trades as free CSV downloads on their data portal (data.binance.vision). This includes the `is_buyer_maker` flag (aggressor side). Order book snapshots are also available.
- **Tardis.dev** — probably the gold standard for historical crypto market data. Full L2/L3 order book, trades with aggressor side, liquidations, funding rates, etc. Pricing starts around **$0–$50/month** for individual/research tiers, with pay-per-use options. Compare that to thousands/month for equivalent equity data.
- **CoinAPI, Kaiko, Amberdata** — institutional-grade providers, more expensive ($hundreds–$thousands/month), but still cheaper than equity equivalents and with more generous trial/free tiers.

**So for your use case specifically:**

If you wanted full trade data with aggressor side + order book snapshots for, say, BTC-USDT perpetual on Binance for a 6-month historical window, you could realistically get it for **$0–$100** through a combination of Binance's free data portal and Tardis.dev. In real-time, it's completely free via the exchange WebSocket APIs.

The equity world is expensive because exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE) treat market data as a revenue stream and charge heavily for it, especially for full depth-of-book feeds like ITCH/PITCH. Crypto exchanges took the opposite approach — data accessibility drives volume drives fee revenue.

Worth noting: the *quality* of crypto order book data is lower in some ways (more spoofing, wash trading, less regulatory oversight on data integrity), so keep that in mind if you're training models on it.

///

Nice. Opus gives me a lot of options for crypto trading. It might be good to start at these places.

6:40pm. ![](images/image-2063.png)

Actually Taris.dev is expensive as fuck.

> Taris.dev start at 700/month minimum. It's pretty expensive.

///

You're right, I should check the actual pricing rather than going from potentially outdated info. Let me look it up.Thanks for the correction. Tardis.dev's minimum order is $300 and their subscriptions are indeed in the hundreds per month range — not the cheap option I initially suggested.

Here's a more accurate picture of the landscape:

**Free options (the real story):**

Binance provides historical trades and aggTrades for free via data.binance.vision — these include the `is_buyer_maker` flag (aggressor side), so you get trade-level order flow for free. However, historical order book data for futures requires a Futures account and is restricted to VIP 1 or above users. So the trade data with aggressor side is free, but the full order book depth history is gated.

For real-time data, every major exchange gives you full depth order book + trade stream with aggressor side via WebSocket for free. The catch is you have to **collect and store it yourself** going forward — you can't go back in time.

**The DIY approach (actually $0):**

The most practical path for someone in your situation would be to start recording the data yourself now. Connect to Binance/Bybit perp WebSocket feeds, capture the L2 order book updates and trade stream, dump it into DuckDB or Parquet files. You'd have exactly the data you need within a few weeks/months of collection. The Tardis open-source `tardis-machine` library can help with normalized collection and is completely free to use for real-time data, connecting directly to exchanges' WebSocket APIs with no API key required.

**Paid historical options:**

- **Tardis.dev**: $300 minimum order for historical, subscriptions from there. Best quality according to most quants.
- **Crypto Lake** (crypto-lake.com): cheaper than Tardis but with less coverage — offers 20-level order book snapshots.
- **CCXT**: Free library for scraping normalized data from exchanges, though you're limited to what exchange REST APIs will give you historically.

You're right that it's still not trivially cheap for historical depth data. But the key difference from equities remains: you *can* collect it yourself for free going forward, and the trade data with aggressor labeling is genuinely free historically. For equities, even real-time depth-of-book feeds require expensive exchange subscriptions before you can even start recording.

///

Nevermind that for now. I need to know how the order book and the order flow behave.

7pm. > What is the SMB Capital Low Float Trade?

///

SMB Capital's **Low Float Trade** is a specific intraday trading setup taught by the proprietary trading firm SMB Capital (founded by Mike Bellafiore and Steve Spencer). Let me search for the most current details on this.Based on what I've found, SMB Capital actually teaches two related low float setups. The one most commonly referred to as **the** "Low Float Trade" is the **Low Float Reversal Trade** (sometimes just called the "Low Float Short" or "backside trade"). Here's how it works:

## The Setup

**Stock characteristics:**
- Stocks with less than ~10 million shares float, with a sweet spot around 5 million shares
- High short interest, often >20% of float
- These are typically low-priced, small-cap stocks that have experienced a parabolic run-up driven by promotion, news catalysts, or speculative momentum

**The Core Idea:**
SMB teaches traders to wait for the "backside of the trade" — staying away from the "front side" saves you from getting caught in a short squeeze and the potential for substantial trading losses. The "front side" is the parabolic move up (which is dangerous to short due to squeeze risk). The "backside" is where the stock has peaked and begins to reverse.

**Why it works:**
Low float stocks are not as competitive as other stocks, and thus easier to trade. When they reverse, the downmove is substantial and fast, with profits realized immediately. When they reverse, you can sit and hold a core position, making fewer trade decisions. Very little capital is necessary to take a very large position, and the risk/reward is enormous.

**The pattern repeats reliably:** These come every week, without fail, as there is a period of pump and then dump in these low float trades.

## How It's Traded

The general approach is:

1. **Identify** a low float stock that has had a parabolic run (often 50-200%+ in days)
2. **Wait** for the move to exhaust — look for the stock to fail at resistance, show declining volume on bounces, or break key intraday support levels
3. **Short the backside** once the reversal is confirmed, typically using VWAP, prior day levels, or intraday support breaks as entry triggers
4. **Manage risk tightly** — this trade requires extreme discipline and risk management given the wide spreads and potential for violent squeezes
5. **Hold a core position** as the stock unwinds, often over multiple days

## Key Nuance

SMB emphasizes this as a **short-side trade on the backside**, not trying to buy the pump or short into strength. The edge comes from patience — letting the overextended move play out and then capitalizing on the inevitable mean reversion in a stock with limited float and exhausted buying.

This ties directly into your interest in order flow analysis, Marko — the "unusual hold on bid/offer" patterns you're detecting could be very relevant for identifying when these low float names are being accumulated or distributed near turning points.

///

This is Tim's trade basically. On the Winning Trade course page they call it a favorite of beginning retail traders.

I myself like anything that is easy to spot.

I've been looking at some 1s charts of BTC and they have pretty smooth trends. But they are also mostly rangebound, and you can't really tell when the turns will come.

7:05pm. I am going to try to push through the entire course in the next week if possible so I can move on to programming. The sooner I can start scanning for setups the better. The sooner I can start studying the market the better. The sooner I can code up my insights the better. The sooner I can start making money the better.

I've thing I've realize from today's lectures is that I am really going to have to look into the order book in order to get a sense for the stocks' liquidity. Or rather my bot will. Whenever I take a position, I am going to have to look into easy it would be to get out if the market turns. It'd be terrible to take a position that's too large and get crushed.

Bella's definitely looking into order book imbalances when making trades. I wonder how I am going to model that?

They also look at very specific patterns. They recounted a pattern where the market would pop if there was a big buy order by JP Morgan below the bid. Some of their traders would trade that consistently for about a month.

One trade he talked about that sometimes happened is that there would be a big buyer on the bid, and then he would keep lifting the bid until it is exhausted.

If I just look at trades, I'd miss that completely.

You know, I don't have to bake everything into a NN model. I can have simpler rule based systems as well. We'll see.

But well, I did make the order book generator for a reason. I can simulate the order book imbalances using that.

If the move is strongly positive there should be an order book imbalance in some direction, right?

7:15pm. Sigh, this is really nice.

There is a challenge to this. And there is the possibility of a big win.

It's ironic that the easiest patterns (abnormal volume & tape speed, order book imbalances, held levels) to detect are also ones that are more likely to be long lasting. Patterns that require deep reads of the market like with that JPM bid, are the ones that are likely to be transient.

I really like that the 16 year old SMB course is all about tape reading. The Trader DNA and the Winning Trader courses aren't about that.

...You know what, once I push through this course, and get my fill, I'll get the tape reading course as well for 30$ off Yandex. It's a more up to date course and could be a great investment for that sum.

7:25pm. ![](images/image-2064.png)

Oh lol, Opus accidentally found the Winning Trader course pirated on this site. I myself only ever found the Tape Reading one on Yandex.

![](images/image-2065.png)

Here is the Trader DNA one as well.

Damn, now I actually found a torrent for the SMB Tape Reading course on [LimeTorrents](https://www.limetorrents.fun/). It's downloading as we speak. It's only 2.7Gb large.

...It stalled at 97% of all things. At any rate, I should be able to download it tomorrow. I guess I'll change my plans a little.

![](images/image-2066.png)

Also GigaCourses has the two SMB courses for cheap as well. Ok.

7:40pm. I didn't expect I'd be able to find the Tape Reading course today. It's annoying that it stalled at 97%, but if it can finish then...should I drop the Foundation course and move on to the tape reading one.

But the Foundation course is pretty much a tape reading course as it is so I am getting what I want either way.

2/8/2026

10:45am. Every hour I put into Patfinder worsens my sleep by some %.

11:20am. Let me get started for today. Let me resume the tape reading course torrent.

Forget gaming. Instead obsess. Obsess like you did about Spiral. Obsess like you did about the old projects. That is the way to build up skill.

Sigh, the tape reading course has no seeds and seems to be stuck at 97%.

11:30am. Ok, if I cannot download it the whole day today I'll just shell out 30$ to get it outright. It got 97% of it in a couple of minutes, and now I am finding waiting hours for it to get that last 3%.

12:35pm. Let me watch the last vid.

12:45pm. Bella says he's not a fan of the large bid trade.

12:50pm. > A really important level trumps the intraday trend of the stock.

1pm. Nice. Done with day 4.

Ugh, that stupid course is still stalled.

1:20pm. ![](images/image-2067.png)

Wow, I am shocked that there are tape reading courses on Udemy.

4:35pm. Today's break took a bit too long. Let me resume the SMB course.

I was really enjoying catching up to Surviving As A Barbarian. The story is really good.

4:40pm. ![](images/image-2068.png)

Held bid at 29.99 and he actually went short the moment it broke below.

4:55pm. ![](images/image-2069.png)

Oh, this guy actually is using a heat chart here.

5pm. ![](images/image-2070.png)

If you're going to use a heatmap what's even the point of these shitty candlesticks?

5:30pm. ![](images/image-2071.png)

Good point on avoiding conference calls. I only learned about this yesterday.

5:45pm. ![](images/image-2072.png)

Interesting that he isn't looking at gap % and premarket volume first and is instead reading the news.

5:50pm. Sigh, just how much of a difference could having access to this info in 2007 and 2008 make which was the period when I was starting out as a trader. I botched that attempt completely didn't I?

5:55pm. Uf, the videos in day 5 are really long.

Good thing is that day 4 pretty much covered most of the trading plays that they do. I might not need the whole course necessarily.

6pm. No, I will.

6:05pm. To be honest, I am getting bored watching these videos, and that means I won't be able to just rush through them.

The video is bad, the audio is noisy, but none of the courses I've ever watched come close to the informational quality of this one.

It's really temping me to get the Trader DNA course instead since it is newer instead of persisting with this one. Like this video I've been watching is literally from 18 years ago.

6:30pm. Done with lunch.

You know what...

![](images/image-2073.png)

It's only 15$ so I'll get it tomorrow. There is no point in being so cheap here.

The Foundation course is very unpolished, so I might get better value for my time if I went through the newer one instead.

![](images/image-2074.png)

This one is 30$ here so it a bit more expensive, but it should be worth getting as well.

Let me do it right now.

The only thing the Trader DNA is making me hesitate about is that the tape reading is 1 module out of 14, but in the 2010 course it is almost half of it.

But what is 15$ to trial the course? Absolutely nothing. If I can succeed at trading, I'll want to try applying to SMB down the road, so they'll be making more money off me than they ever would by selling these courses.

6:40pm. Ugh, CourseHabitat doesn't accept cards, only crypto. I guess I'll pass. Gigacourses has them as well, but they are 30% more expensive there, but it's still in the acceptable range.

Gigacourses processes orders manually for some reason.

I ended up finding a torrent for the DNA of Successful Trading course and it has seeders. It's 20Gb and it seems like it has full availability.

7pm. ![](images/image-2075.png)

From what I can tell the torrent is from a version of the course in 2016. The newest one (in the screenshot) is split into 14 modules, while the 2016 course that I am torrenting is split into 9 weeks.

Ok, it's donwloading in the background. It doesn't matter too much. I'll focus on the 2010 course regardless.

7:15pm. Focus. I have the capability to go through the 2010 course in less than half a month and then I can start programming. I cannot let myself fall into the trap of just watching course videos forever. I'll build up the foundations and then start in earnest.

Plus just learning passively is boring. It's best when you can apply the lessons you've learned.

8:05pm. ![](images/image-2076.png)

I might have found a more up to date version on this site.

You know what, let me chance it.

![](images/image-2077.png)

They also have the Futures Foundation program that I didn't know even exists, but the files require premium membership on FileAxa to download them.

8:20pm. Paid the 18 euro price for a 1 month subscription to FileAxa. Ok, let's see if the trader DNA course is the up to date one or the one from 2016.

Man, I have no idea where I even found the trading foundations torrent.

Let me stop the program.

Lol, yeah, I have fibre optic, so my download speeds should cap out at 125 Mb/s (megabytes). I am looking at 7mb/s and wondering if I have more room left. Yes, I do. I can get the course files in parallel.

8:35pm. Tsk, unfortunately the Trader DNA course was from the 2016.

8:45pm. ![](images/image-2078.png)

This is how the video looks like. Some asshole must have downscaled it and pasted the watermarks all over it. Ptuu.

At any rate, I am going to focus on the trading foundations since it focuses on tape reading.

![](images/image-2079.png)

The winning trader course only goes up to 2018. But that's still a huge improvement.

8:55pm. Anyway, I can give the DNA course a pass. Without any order flow content it is useless to me.

Good news is that I have enough bandwidth to get all 3 courses today. I wonder what the futures course contains? It isn't even featured on the SMB Training site for whatever reason. Claude says it is sold through their futures division.

9:15pm. I like the futures course. It has pdfs instead of docx files, it is organized chronologically rather than having the files randomly strewn about, and the videos are high resolution and the audio isn't noisy. I have to add, the files are also named nicely.

9:25pm. Who knows, maybe the futures course will be a bigger gain than the other two stock courses.

It would have sucked to shell out 2k for the DNA course only to find out that it isn't very actionable.

Thankfully I only had to pay 18 euros instead.

9:25pm. Now if only the tape reading course would finish downloading.

![](images/image-2080.png)
![](images/image-2081.png)

I haven't heard about iMF tracker, but I have about Axia futures.

9:40am. I might as well get these courses tomorrow after the midnight reset.

In fact, since I'll be starting out my systems development on crypto, the content might be more topical than the stock trading stuff in fact.

9:50pm. Nice, very nice.

This is how the post work rest period should be spent.

While I stopped watching the SMB course past 6pm, I put in the extra effort to get added educational material for myself. And as I watch the videos and learn these concepts I am thinking how I will express them through programming. I have had some idea for how to deal with order flow. It's not that difficult.

One thing I've realized as I watched the tape examples is that the tape is very bursty. You have many second where nothing gets printed and then you have anther page appearing in only a few frames of the video.

Trades are often hitting one side or the other in sequences, so it's not unusual to see 4-12 trades on the bid, followed by 4-12 trades on the offer in quick bursts. If I just randomly switch between bid and offer, things won't work well.

But that can be dealt with.

Most importantly though, I am going to have to make the model obey the delta time instead of just using it in expectation. I got that wrong in the video even though it was right initially. For when the trade count is above the mean, I'll instead scale the drift and volality directly.

9:55pm. Complete engrossment and obsession is how I created Spiral. It is how I became the programmer that I am today. I **am** going to master trading.

10:20pm. Weird that Merril Black is very bullish about market profile. He says that he traded price action and market profile made a huge difference to him.

Right now I am watching some intro psychology videos since he begged me to do it.

10:45am. ![](images/image-2082.png)

Confirmed that there is a version of it here for free. Interesting, I didn't know there are different versions of it.

And yes, had I looked, I could have found it 16 years ago. But good luck figuring out a probabilistic programming approach in that day and age.

I simply didn't have the skills then.

10:55am. Agh, so annoying the tape reading course is stuck at 97% the whole day. But probably its content is already baked in the Foundations course. The Foundations course might be their in-house offering according to Opus. I think its concent is now essentially split into 3 courses: DNA, Winning Trader and Tape Reading courses. All of this could set you back a cool 15k without any discounts.

11:15pm. ![](images/image-2083.png)

Linda Raschke recommends market profile? First time I heard about it.

11:20pm. Let me have dinner here. I'll leave the futures course for tomorrow. Futures traders really swear by market profile don't they. In fact, I couldn't find good resources on Youtube about this, so this material is a very good find for me.

Sigh, since I have the fondations course, I guess I don't really need the tape reading one. The examples in the videos have them trading defunct companies like RIMM and AIG. Those are already covered in the foundations course.

12:05am. ![](images/image-2084.png)

Feels like giberish. Let me go to bed here. I'll continue this tomorrow. The more I study, the more viable my quant analysis feels.

2/9/2026

11:20am. I am up. It's time to obsess again. In this state of mind, it seems I have early morning nightmares before falling back asleep, but I think this kind of pressure is preferable to playing games and then being tired during the day.

Job Hunters Are So Desperate That They’re Paying to Get Recruited

> Landing a white-collar job is getting so tough that candidates—not companies—are paying recruiters to match them with positions. 

People are starting to pay recruiters to land them a job. Since Covid ended the labor market just keeps getting worse and worse. The Tao Ceti job as bad as it turned out to be in the end was a huge stroke of luck. I managed to get out of the market before the worst happened. What's going to happen is probably another market crash once the AI bubble pops.

This would just make the job market for software engineers even worse.

At some point it has to get better, but who knows how many years that will be? I'll be a profitable trader by that time.

> So AI writes the job applications that then get screened by AI to decide whether to proceed with an interview that may include an AI interviewer. Truly the machines are taking over.

Lol. Truly the machines are taking over.

12pm. Let me watch the market profile videos.

12:10pm. It seems the reset didn't happen last night for some reason, and I can't download the courses. I just got one by Mike Valtos. Crap, now I am just wasting my time getting gorged on that crap.

Let me focus on the SMB courses. I only have the capacity to digest so many courses.

![](images/image-2085.png)

He says that market profile people only look at the range for the gaps instead of the close.

12:25pm. ![](images/image-2086.png)
> There have been a lot of studies done on serial correlation in financial markets.

And no correlation was found. Is he going to say that there is correlation in value migration?

> Just because we close higher one day there is essentially a 50/50 chance that we close higher the following day.

![](images/image-2087.png)

If this is an actual effect, I wonder if it could be used to swing trade?

But he hasn't yet said that it exists.

12:40pm. ![](images/image-2088.png)

This feels like gibberish.

12:50pm. You know what, nevermind this course. I am not impressed by the market profile stuff. The tape reading SMB teaches is more interesting than this. Maybe I'll get back to this course later.

Sure, looking at volume profiles is better than looking than OHLC bars, but I knew that already.

Let me have breakfast here and I will get back to the foundations course. I want to prioritize getting through it. Then I'll look at the Winning Trader course to see the various setups they are teaching.

The foundations course is great. They come out with what is most important and effective (holds) and then move on from there.

My challenge is to quantify it, and then I will be minting money.

Now that I have some programming skills and ML knowledge, the trading material they are teaching feels so primitive. These guys don't know a lick of statistics.

Or rather, the language they are using to teach is dumb.

![](images/image-2089.png)

I'll give Mike Valtos' course a chance since it focuses on order flow.

2:15pm. ![](images/image-2090.png)

Why the fuck are the quotes crossed?

2:25pm. ![](images/image-2091.png)

So over here he is waiting for the stock to tell him whether it is going to hold above 50 or not. So he's waiting for a hold. I really find it very hard to read both the time and sales and the order book. Sometimes large order would flash and get pulled, it's hard.

Right now the prices are just girating above and below 50.

![](images/image-2092.png)

Nikkei 225 caught my eye since it was up 4% on Friday. I didn't think it would be breaking out to new high.

2:30pm. ![](images/image-2093.png)

This is interesting. NYSE stepped up with a big bid and got whacked. Bella is explaining how this is bearish. The seller might have a big sell order otherwise why would he hit it so aggressively? He would have tried to finese it.

2:35pm. ![](images/image-2094.png)

This could be a part of the strategy. A big hit could be a catalyst, and I could look at the book just to make sure that no big orders are in front.

![](images/image-2095.png)

This is a bit interesting. A big bid comes in and gets taken out.

![](images/image-2096.png)

Yeah, it is making be a bit bullish that the price isn't going down despite the big bids getting taken out., but what it this trade right here? It totally messes up the chart. A tape reader would just ignore it though. This is why it's a poor idea to rely on price charts.

![](images/image-2097.png)

Oh, I think this is finally a hold.

![](images/image-2098.png)

50k on the bid. 7k on the bid. So this is what we've been waiting for.

![](images/image-2099.png)

He quietly went long 800 shares in front.

Yeah, this is it. This is what I've been missing in my trading education. You really cannot possibly miss this on the tape.

![](images/image-2100.png)

And it dropped.

![](images/image-2101.png)

It went back to 50 and now it broke again. He says that we'd want to play the downward momentum.

![](images/image-2102.png)

Oh, my god those quotes far from the action are driving me insane. The tape and the chart are telling a completely different story.

3:05pm. ![](images/image-2103.png)

He went short below the 49.89 level as that was where last time a hold was there.

![](images/image-2104.png)

There is another trade here far out of line to mess up the charts.

3:15pm. ![](images/image-2105.png)

Another hold at 50.

To be honest, I didn't really notice the hold at .89 that well. I should review.

...Let me backtrack.

![](images/image-2106.png)

Yeah, it should be around here, but it wasn't a very strong hold.

3:25pm. ![](images/image-2107.png)

Lol, he is getting chopped up and squeezed. Shouldn't the plan be to cover above 50?

![](images/image-2108.png)

So now the plan is to look for a held bid around the current level.

3:40pm. ![](images/image-2109.png)

Large seller at .49.

Not sure I like how this stock is trading. He's been trying to catch a move for quite a while now. It's been nearly an hour after the open and it still hasn't resulted in a clean move.

3:55pm. Wow, I am done with the 53m video.

Ok, that was informative.

Was that my first real life trading session where I could see an actual trader trade and have him explain his reasoning for being in the trade? Yes, it seems like it.

All the other sessions were bite sized pieces.

4pm. Let me watch the stocks for the close video and then I'll stop so I can do the chores and exercises.

Actually let me do it now.

If the levels are this important, maybe a different kind of model instead of geometric brownian motion would be better? Daytrading is very sensitive to execution, getting in too late would kill the results.

5:15pm. Let me resume. Let's see if I can watch some other vids in day 5.

I really find keeping track of the box quite difficult. I have no idea how Bella can watch both the inner market as well as the tape. I find it very hard to focus.

5:40pm. Ok, I am at my limit as to how much I can focus on the tape for one day. My eyes are just glazing over at this point.

If I had to do that as my real job, I think I'd rather just do something else. Thankfully I'll let a bot do it instead.

I'll skip some of these ultra low audio quality videos where they are just chatting around as they review the trades.

I want to focus on the most obvious trades which are holds and abnormal volume and speed.

As a rule, the easier it is for a bot to spot something, the easier it would be for me to spot it as well.

5:45pm. I'll do half and half. I'll watch the tape with the SMB guys for a bit, and maybe I'll watch some of the other courses when I am tired of that.

Let me see if the refresh has gone through.

...Not yet. I'll download the iMF and some other order flow courses tomorrow.

I am looking at the reset time on the dashboard, and last night it was 4h, but now it's saying 7h left.

![](images/image-2110.png)

This place is nice, it has a lot of 3d modeling courses. I used to be into that back in 2022. Never went far with it.

Well, even if I never download anything else from this site, it would still have been worth the price tag.

6:20pm. Nevermind, the SMB futures course is devoid of useful information. A lot of traders are deluded where their edge comes from given that they are buried in the noise and tend to ascribe it to the equivalent of reading tea leaves and astrology.

Wasn't there that market wizard who was making a lot of money using fibonacci's?

There are all kinds of cranks out there. No wonder it's not featured on the main site.

Let me take a look at the course by Mike Valtos.

![](images/image-2111.png)

At least this course is entirely on order flow.

6:35pm. ![](images/image-2112.png)
> If you're watching this it's moving so fricking fast.

7:15pm. Done with lunch. Let me continue watching the course by Mike.

7:35pm. ![](images/image-2113.png)

The essence of the system that Mike Bellafiore is teaching is that you want to be short below important levels and long above them. It's very nice and simple.

If you look back at 2025, I was spitting on breakouts considering them too unreliable, but I never considered trading around big volume price levels. Footprint charts should be a natural fit for that sort of trading.

You can see those big volume levels of 4-5 contracts each in the screenshot. Those are trades of 200k worth of Bitcoin.

The thing is, this system can be somewhat obscured by the noise, but what the other option? To trade in random places?

7:45pm. Remember the VWAP system?

What would be the easiest way of implementing the SMB system in a rules based mechanical fashion? Look back at the high volume levels in the last 1-10m and ask whether the inner market is above or below that. That is what the trend is.

Interestingly, it could be done off of footprint charts, but not based of candlesticks.

7:55pm. ![](images/image-2114.png)

I am feeling so inspired right now. Bella was very persistent in flipping between long and short as the market moved between key levels.

These are the points of control on the footprint charts. This is way easier than I even though.

The VWAP system is adjancent to this one, but not quite it. It would always lag.

Oh yeah, remember that series on the Anchored VWAP system on Bookmap? I thought it was nonsense, but not really. You can see how the POCs dominate on the charts by Mike Valtos.'

8:25pm. I can do it. I should be able to do it with this insight.

I knew a lot of things about trading.

I knew about momentum. I knew about volatility.

But I didn't really understand volume up to now. I only understood it up to the level of knowing that elevated volume periods also lead to strong moves.

But if I understand the holds as points of control on a footprint chart, then that gives me a precise way to orient myself and control my risk - the main thing I was missing in my system!

Even after going through Carmine Rosato's Order Flow course I didn't really understand the essence of the abnormal deltas he was looking for. I sort of comprehended they happened at important places, but I didn't really understand the way to take advantage of them.

The advantage is that I can just trade around those levels, and ignore the random spots inbetween and it will give me a very good RR.

It should be enough to let me become a profitable trader.

Previously my best strategies were to flip around VWAP on the 1m chart or you know how my long term system was to flip every 2 weeks. Yeah, those are crappy systems which is why I am not using them.

But this is really good.

The disadvantage of using holds as levels is that the market can often whip around them, but the reality is, the market whips around either way. So I'll be whipped while trading either way.

The only choice is whether I want to give this system a try and be whipped on holds or whether I want to make random entries and exists and be whipped on them.

![](images/image-2115.png)

It's just crazy how much more volume the key level here has compared to the rest. If that isn't a trend indicator then nothing is.

This is what I was missing, the key conceptual insight! It's very counter unintuitive. I mean, Bella was talking about the levels in his book, the One Good Trade and I didn't understand it. It's like I was in a haze.

8:50pm. Let me stop for the day here for real. I need to take a bath.

I'll finish these courses, program a system and start trading for real.

Let's take it one step a time.

The most important thing of all is understanding.

Livermore said it best: "Millions come more easily to a trader than thousands did in the days of his ignorance."

This is the best feeling of all. The feeling of coming to an understanding of a difficult subject.

2/10/2026

10:35am. Had a hard time falling asleep as I was excited.

Now that I've finally internalized the concept of holds, the edge that I was struggling to find is finally in my grasp. Previously I wasn't really sure if I can make it, but now I think the odds are 100% in my favor.

10:40am. Let me see if I can download some of those other courses.

Yes, I can. Let me get the iMF Tracker Order Flow and the Axia Futures Footprint courses.

10:40am. Though I had a hard time falling asleep, I am decently rested. It seems it's gaming that does lasting damage.

Anyway since I know how to daytrade now, I could reasonably do some demo trading, but let's leave that until I am done with the courses.

11am. Come to think of it, had I bothered learning to daytrade back in 2000s I could have just focus on unusual holds and that would have gotten me above the 25k range.

...

Or maybe not. You need the capability to allow for some whipsaw in order to trade like this. It would have been excruciating to deal with the PDT rule. But I could have just opened a cash account.

Yeah, I see it. I could have won, but all the restrictions I placed on myself barred my path.

11:10am. ![](images/image-2116.png)

Ugh, will this stupid torrent ever finish downloading? It's been stuck as 97% for days. I'll give it today and then stop.

11:50am. https://youtu.be/NIXd3PEbsNk
The Torture Will Continue Until Shareholder Value Improves

I'll leave this GN video for tomorrow.

Let me watch some videos. I'll finish SMB day 5 and then switch to the order flow course.

12:05pm. ![](images/image-2117.png)
> Pattern recognition - A big offer coming lower

Let me watch this.

![](images/image-2118.png)

The main question for me is whether this large sell order would show up as a major POC on a footprint chart? Does the level really have a lot of volume? I'd hard for me to know just by looking at the tape. I might make this my last tape reading video. I should be focusing on the tape and it's not doing it for me. I end up defaulting to listening to the guy's voice and tuning out because trying to keep track of the volume in my head is hard work.

If this pattern is just going to be an easily detectable hold on a footprint chart then I am wasting my time reading the tape.

Ugh, I am a bit tired today and in need of a break.

12:15pm. ![](images/image-2119.png)

Ok, this would definitely be a hold.

12:20pm. ![](images/image-2120.png)

Yeah, this isn't that bad. Large offers are a good hint. There is no reason not to at least visualize them in a heatmap.

It could give you confidence while trading.

But the basic strategy is to be short below high volume POCs and long above them. The latest POC is the most important and the higher the volume the strong the expected trend. Using this I will be able to pick tops and bottoms much better. I'll be able to be in tune with the market.

I will be able to have something that has eluded me for a long time - skill and consistency. And I will be able to make money this time for good, without struggling to find jobs at companies. Much more upside, much more interesting work.

12:25pm. The trick is that you have to look at a chart relative to some strategy you have in mind.

I didn't understand footprint charts before because the price action was simply too noisy. POCs seem random, even after I learned about holds from SMB, I didn't at all connect them to POCs on a footprint chart. I didn't look at the chart with the intention of being whipped.

I looked at a footprint chart the same way I'd look at a candlestick, and so I didn't see the added possibilities it gave to me.

I used to try to frame high volume bars as being bullish, but as I gained experince as a trader I realizd that they are just as a random as anything else.

Yes, elevated volatility periods tend to be accompanied by high volume. Large moves tend to accompany high volume and it looks great on cheery picked example, but in practice I realized that this doesn't matter if the stock is just as likely to go down as it would to go up. High volatility without any ability to control the risk or direction just means I'd lose money faster.

But now I understand that I could trade around these levels. Be long if the bid is higher than the level, be short if the offer is lower than the level and I'll catch the move to either side with low risk. I needed this so badly.

Feb 9th 2026. The day I finally figured out the market. Or rather, I just came to an understanding of a single profitable setup and its variations, but that is enough to graduate from a loser to a winner.

12:40pm. Done with the video.

Done with day 5. I'll to the course by Mike Valtos.

Then I will be able to start playing around in demo mode maybe and also resume coding. Before that I'll also check out the other courses that I got.

There is one major thing I should do. I've been having Opus create candlestick charts, and I should test it's capability for creating footprint charts. I don't know why, but Quantconnect wasn't doing well with data from Massive.

I didn't want to bother testing Opus with footprint charts because I suspected it couldn't do it, but I think footprints and heatmaps are the next step in my own visualization work. Fuck it, I'll just create my own charting library if it's giving me trouble. Opus will be able to do that without much trouble.

Let me have breakfast here.

2:35pm. It seems the Axia Futures course has some file errors unfortunately.

I guess I'll give it a pass. The iMF Tracker course is also unordered.

![](images/image-2121.png)

Surprised there is a course by Neerav on building a data store of all things.

![](images/image-2122.png)

Thomas like this guy. I need to show this site to him.

2:55pm. ![](images/image-2123.png)

I like this. These are really good charts.

You have to keep in mind that these are 5m charts. It's likely that 70 BTC worth of volume in a single level isn't something that is done in a single trade. It likely took half a minute to a minute for the trades to execute and the hold to develop.

![](images/image-2124.png)
![](images/image-2125.png)
![](images/image-2126.png)

Axia offers 3 self guided courses. One is based on footprint charts, one is on volume profiling and one is on price ladder trading.

I am interested in at least watching the intro for the other two.

And even though there was some data corruption in the rar files, most of the files are there as far as I can tell. I think I am missing the drill 1b in module 9, but that's about it.

A lot of the courses I've downloaded are actually from this site. The SMB course had the name of this site plastered over it.

I am watching the price ladder intro course I am curious as to how they are doing it.

![](images/image-2128.png)

Ngl, this course looks really interesting. Futures price ladders have an integrated volume, so they are much easier to deal with than stock boxes.

Anyway the site I mentioned is basically a course sharing site like many other. They don't give a bunch of free courses hosted on file sharing sites, so it's not as good of a value.

Stops runs, the bane of the retal trader.

3:40pm. ![](images/image-2130.png)

Didn't know that footprint charting packages allow value areas.

Let me finish this video. I am really enjoying imagining how I am going to trade. I know that I only need to have the patience to wait for the holds and then I'll be able to profit off of them.

I'll drop the SMB course to focus on the futures order flow ones. Then I am going to start studying the data and modeling the price action.

I'll ditch the model I've made and ask Opus about the brownian bridge and move from there.

5:45pm. ![](images/image-2131.png)

To be honest this course is pretty boring. Instead of just filling in the time, I wish he'd get to actual strategies. Descriptions aren't worth shit in the market.

At any rate, my bro's birthday is today so I am going out. Let me finish the video and I close up.

8:25pm. I am back. Before I left, the Axia Futures price ladder course finished downloading and I'll look into it tomorrow. I had some wine, plus it's late so no way do I feel like studying now.

2/11/2026

10:40am. I've been up for 20m. I am looking forward to resuming the courses. The tape reading course is still at 97%, but the Axia Futures price ladder course actually downloaded.

I am not sure what to think. It doesn't seem like resets work properly on FileAxa. I won't be able to download more courses today. At any rate, let me focus on the crypto course by Mike Valtos and then I'll check out the Axia Futures one.

![](images/image-2132.png)

This could finally be a first good module. I want to see whether the course by Mike actually end up offering me a strategy.

10:55am. ![](images/image-2133.png)
> Wait until the bar closes for that confirmation.

You really shouldn't do this.

Is that guy any good at all?

The way Mike trades when these holds develop is that he wants to be long or short as soon as possible.

![](images/image-2134.png)

Using POCs is much better than than using bar lows and highs as the stop or entry points. I wonder why Lance it teaching crap with the 2 min bar trend system? That cannot be how he trades himself.

11:10am. ![](images/image-2135.png)

Extreme volume at a level like on this chart here tends to be followed by a large move in either direction. You just have to follow the trend, and be patient in waiting for the setup.

I think this guy is kind of full of shit though, but the footprint charts are gold. I don't think the delta means anything at all.

Sigh, this is so fucking easy and I didn't realize it at all.

I really messed it up in 2007 - 2014. You know what, fine, it doesn't matter that I didn't make money during that periods. Maybe 3k would have been too little to succeed either way.

But the fact that I could not realize this concept is a large failure of research on my part.

Unless you understand how volume works, it's impossible to be successful as a trader and I didn't.

I couldn't do it as a gamer, but as a software developer my research abilities have gone up significantly. That is the main difference between me now and the me of 20 years ago.

In the end, the experience does count for something. I haven't wasted my time. I have a different mindset now.

11:20am. ![](images/image-2136.png)
> Imagine getting short ahead of this guy that has 70 bitcoin to sell.

No, don't! Don't imagine that! That's the wrong way to trade. Rather just react. Short 1 tick below the lever or buy 1 tick above. 

This guy doesn't know how to trade, I am sure of that now. Maybe I should just switch to the Axia futures course before I get any more bad advice.

I mean, think about it, just what could these tiny delta differences tell you? Absolutely nothing.

Prior to the big hold developing the market has been moving sideways doing nothing. All the levels have low volume. It's a place to avoid trading.

![](images/image-2137.png)
> You could sell it right here, be happy and go downstairs to make your coffee...

So you'd active in a trade, but go off to do something else when you should be watching it? I am facepalming here.

11:25am. Let me skip to the Axia Futures course, hearing this guy talk is embarassing.

What he should have said is that you absolutely have to be paying attention when those big levels start to develop and when the volume starts coming in. Then you take a position. And would be absolutely impossible to notice this pattern on a candlestick chart.

You cannot actually anticipate that this pattern will develop based on deltas or anything else. You have to be present to see and take the trade.

Speed is the answer. The levels are the question.

11:35am. ![](images/image-2138.png)

fttuts people suck. They paste their shitty watermark and they leave a cursor with a highlight in the recording. But it's better than nothing. It beats paying 1200k for this course.

This coures will have mentors doing live trading so I'll be able to learn exactly how they are doing it.

I already sort of know, but there might be strategies I am not aware of.

12:25pm. Let me resume. Took some time to send an email to Thom recommending Psdly to him.

![](images/image-2139.png)

I appreciate that they show strategies and will have live market trading.

The reason why I could figure it out in Bookmap is because even though they spell it out, I didn't really understand how to deal with noise.

12:45pm. ![](images/image-2140.png)

I thought delta is nonsense, but if this guy is saying there could be a strategy around it, I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

12:50pm. ![](images/image-2141.png)
> You only need 1 trade strategy to be prosperous.

The video goes on for another 40m, so let me have breakfast here.

I really have high hopes for this video. Maybe learning from futures trades will be better than from stock traders. I feel like SMB could really have done more on the tech side.

2:10pm. ![](images/image-2142.png)

First time I see the history of footprint charts here.

2:15pm. ![](images/image-2143.png)

Pretty good intro.

2:25pm. ![](images/image-2144.png)

I dislike these kinds of footprints. All the colors are distracting and I find it difficult to figure out the POCs.

In fact, if things are like this on a chart, then it would actually be far harder to do it on tape. I'd have to do math to sum up the number. Here I just have to add two numbers and I can barely do it.

> Certain strategies like momentum or flow tend to be better revealed using a Point & Figure chart.

Interesting.

> What are P&F charts?

///

Point & Figure (P&F) charts are a charting method that filters out time and focuses purely on **price movement**. Unlike candlestick or bar charts, they don't have a time axis — a new column or mark is only added when price moves by a specified amount.

**How they work:**

Columns of **X's** represent rising prices and columns of **O's** represent falling prices. Two key parameters define the chart:

- **Box size** — the minimum price increment each X or O represents (e.g., $1 per box).
- **Reversal amount** — how many boxes price must move in the opposite direction to start a new column (commonly 3 boxes, called a "3-box reversal").

So on a 3-box reversal chart, if price is rising (X column), it keeps adding X's as long as it moves up by at least one box. It only switches to a new O column if price drops by 3 or more boxes from the high.

**Why traders use them:**

- **Noise filtering** — by ignoring small moves and time, P&F charts strip out a lot of intraday chop and highlight meaningful supply/demand shifts.
- **Clear support/resistance** — horizontal rows of X's and O's at the same price level make S/R zones visually obvious.
- **Pattern recognition** — classic P&F patterns like double tops/bottoms, triple tops/bottoms, bullish/bearish catapults, and triangle formations have well-defined entry signals.
- **Price targets** — P&F has built-in target methods (horizontal and vertical counts) that project price objectives based on the width or height of consolidation patterns.

**Relevance to order flow:** P&F charts can be interesting for what you're working on because they're essentially a primitive form of filtering for "meaningful" price action — somewhat analogous to detecting when price is being held at a level versus just passing through. Some order flow traders overlay P&F logic to identify when accumulation/distribution is happening at key levels.

He says that color is great and make it easy to make quick effective decisions. Ok, I was wrong. The darker areas do make it easier to spot important levels.

![](images/image-2147.png)

Ah, the shades are showing delta. I thought they are showing absolute volume. Absolute volume at a level is more important.

2:55pm. ![](images/image-2148.png)

So they use all 3 tools. I've never seen the market profile course anywhere. But nevermind it.

![](images/image-2149.png)

Didn't think they'd talk about Bookmap.

3pm. ![](images/image-2150.png)

This course is starting out very strong.

It's not that it's just hyping up a particular tool, but is covering their strengths and weaknesses.

> Weaknesses of one tool can be a strength of another.

3:05pm. Regarding level 3, he says that it's very noisy and it can be nigh on impossible to make discretionary trading decisions. This is what SMB is trying to teach us to use.

Though I am wondering why he is putting Bookmap in the same bucket?

![](images/image-2151.png)

Here are the strengths of the footprint. He says that different tools offset the weaknesses of the other.
