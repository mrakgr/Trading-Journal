10:50am. Let me resume yesterday's programming session. Here is to 2026.

4:45pm. I messed up. I didn't expect that increasing the sequence length by from 60 to 198 would increase the training time by more than a few hours.

Right it's barely past 50% and it has been training for 4h.

I'll have to find something else to do in the meantime.

I guess I'll watch some of the old SMB course videos.

5pm. ![](images/image-2039.png)

He says that they're trying to put a story on the stock.

> Leading indicator.

I sure hope so.

He says that this is really simple, but requires practice.

He says that when you spent time on this stuff the different algos are very easy to indentify. There are like 15 different algos he says.

Ok, I could code that up. Make a generative model, and then go the other way.

5:50pm. Done with the video.

The training needs about 40k more batches until it's done. I guess I'll have to wait for that to finish before I can start playing Pathfinder.

6:45pm. Ugh, the training crashed after 6h. More details in the video.

Nia Liston is getting an anime. Let me get back to trying out the gMLP architecture.

The recent successes are making more more hopeful. My motivation is going up.

2:10pm. Had an apointment with an orthoped today. I'll take the chance to finally put together the clips I recorded and post them online.

I just realized that I haven't posted a video in over a month. It's going to be quite a lot of content.

2:50pm. It's rendering. Nice.

7pm. Time for WotR.

I am considering getting Rogue Trader as well. I didn't feel like doing any programming today. I'll get back into it tomorrow.

Quantifying Order Flow (Pt. 2)

Here is the video. The next one is scheduled in a few days.

1/30/2026

11:30am. Got up over an hour ago. Let me finally start.

My right arm is quite stiff from the shoulder injection I got yesterday.

Hopefully this will melt that calcificate for good.

The previous attempt failed.

3:30pm. https://mangabuddy.com/magical-girls-defeat-trial/chapter-1

Holy crap, this is way more explicit than I thought it would be. FuckNovelpia is back in another form and I was looking for Magical Girl Defeat Addiction (it can be found under the name 'magic girl defeat addiction' now) and found this.

Lol, anyway let me chill for a bit longer and I will resume. Right now I am unclear on what my near term goals are.

Trade of the month. One day I'll be capable of catching them.

More data centers in space nonsense. I thought it was a joke by Bezos, but Elon is now seriously pushing it.

The Nightmare.

7:45pm. I guess this week it's another downleg in the market. Gold and silver dumped, and BTC is now solidly below 80k.

I myself am done making simplistic models. I need to move on to making realistic ones.

The plan is to take a break from programming and go through the SMB Capital course that I downloaded a while ago.

I need to start baking in actual order flow patterns into the generative model. Swapping between episodes is very obvious.

8:50pm. I'll slow down my pace and think more carefully how I want to do modeling.

In efficient markets it's hard to do trend following. The patterns where drift/volatility is greater than 0.1 is rare.

Most of the patterns are volatility with no drift.

9:05pm. Starting tomorrow, I am going to slow down. Yeah, just programming isn't going to get me far. I need to start studying again.

I know 1 pattern which is the held bid/offer, but there have to be other ones. I need to get everything I can from SMB.

Then I will try coding it up into a coherent system. If it turns out that tape reading absolutely cannot be distilled into a neural network then so be it. I'll apologize to Thomas for misleading him again (the first time was the Hopfield dictionary) and move on to something else.

The 107k I have lying around is permission for me to put the try this. If I am not going to do it now then when?

Ok, so price patterns on 1s charts are one thing, but there could very well be differences when I look into actual order flow, especially at extreme situations.

2:25pm. Here is what it takes to get hired at SMB.

* 100 trades in the last 60 trading sessions.
* Winners bigger than losses.
* Going through the SMB Training.

4k price tags. I don't have enough in my bank account even if I wanted to. I'll leave it for later.

I am going to focus on the old course, and if I am having success with that I'll definitely go through the main one even if it means paying 2-4k in fees. Because if I could attain profitability it would be worth it. Right now it isn't.

Who knows whether shelling out money for this is right or not, but either way it will take me time to build up a track record and make these systems. I am not in a hurry. Let me start with day 2 from the old course and I'll go from there.

2:30pm. Let me do the chores and then I will get started with the course.

I wonder if the dumbass founders are still long this shit or if they've bailed earlier? I bet BTC is very scary to hold for many people right now. Stock indices just refuse to collapse though despite the fundamentals getting worse and worse.

The Killer Mistake to Avoid at All Costs

Let me watch this.

I am trying to figure out what my goals are. I thought about the opening plays and yes, that is what I want to do. Forget generating the whole day, I'll cut out everything, but the first hour and focus solely on that to start off.

My beginner's strategy will be to focus only on the first hour. I'll generate some consolidations and some opening drives and focus solely on that.

The random price action model is quite powerful. I can take advantage of deviations from it.

As I go through the SMB course, I will focus just on that, the opening drive.

4:10pm. Let me start going through the course. This will take me a while.

4:15pm. ![](images/image-2053.png)

This is my first time seeing Brett Steenbarger talk. I used to read just blog a lot back in the day.

> You want to trade with a microscope - that's the tape, and trade with the telescope, that's the big picture.
> I want to be my goals, not just have goals! Do you see the difference? Too many people have goals, like you have a car, you have a goal. It's something separate from you.
> And finally the best goals are based on strengths, on what do well.

Great talk and I am already halfway in.

4:45pm. Balance vs imbalance. I think I understand it now. Balance is when drift < volatility. When it's below 0.1 the noise dominates the drift. And when it's the opposite That is when you breakouts. In the market, I find that it goes between extremes.

I'll really want to get my hands on trade sides and study those in nuance.

I think I need to introduce a concept. A trade can be highly probable to hit the bid or the ask, but at the same time when you have absorbtions or held levels, those levels tend to hold. In other words, in breakouts to the upside, the bids should be holding. Volume on the bid shouldn't drop the price, but volume on the ask should lead to the levels rising.

And in absorbtion, strong momentum to the upside where trades are mostly getting executed on the ask will start having difficulty pushing prices up.

The model I have now doesn't represent this well.

4:55pm. Yeah, this is a major weakness of my modeling effort.

I need to model the passive and aggresive flow and the interplay between them.

5pm. The sooner I start thinking about the bids and the asks the better. I have to admit the experiments really made me realize just how the drift and volatility components interact.

Let me finish the video instead of falling into thought here.
